The investor or landlord who ignores how his tenants and real estate assets are treated does so at his own peril. The icing on the cake in this very competitive market is FM; hence Landlords must ensure that their facilities management standard is commensurate (or even surpass) the tenants’ expectations. Engr Femi Akintunde explains in this article, that the investor\/landlord’s quest to exceed tenant’s expectation must start with the budgeting process ...<\/em><\/strong>\n\nThe aspect of budgeting for facilities management or maintenance as it applies to the investor is not what a lot of people consider to be an important exercise.  A lot of property investors don’t do it – people take it as ‘I will spend when I need to spend’.\n\nSo, when you are considering your annual budget for all your expenses, including children’s education, household expenses for food, medical insurance and so on; you must understand that your physical environment – home, office, etc also needs to be budgeted for. This will help you determine how well these budgeted costs fit into the resources plan expectation and expenditure.\n\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\n\nFor real estate, if you spend on your buildings without planning for it, you cannot control your costs. You will end up spending more than is required. The budgeting process enables you to anticipate events. It enables you to prevent crisis, to be better prepared you for any emergencies, and to put contingency plans in place in case of shortages or inadequacies.\n\nAnother advantage of budget planning for your real estate asset is that you are able to get better prices than if you have to do negotiations at short notices. For example, if a heavy-duty generator that is to be serviced every 250 hours is planned for, you will have an idea of how much every servicing costs. You will have an idea of how long it takes to get to 250 hours; so you will be ready to meet the costs and schedule the servicing at a time convenient to all.\n\nOtherwise, you increase the tendency is to run the generator beyond the recommendation hours and get a breakdown. Then the pressure comes to fix the generator before residents arrive or start to complain. You will have to buy parts under emergency and many times you end up spending more. The risk of buying inferior quality is also very high in unplanned situations. There will also be the attendant effect of the impact of this breakdown on your tenants’ lifestyle (or business in the case of commercial spaces); and this will come into play when they are considering renewing their leases.\n\n<strong>Read also<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p class=\"entry-post-title\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-best-of-2018\/\">The Best of 2018<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p class=\"entry-post-title\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/is-ibeju-lekki-nigerias-most-promising-real-estate-location\/\">Is Ibeju Lekki Nigeria’s most promising real estate location?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHow does the budgeting process take place?  There are two aspects: the capital and operation budget.\n\nOperations Budget is for the expenses that you incur to maintain the asset in a form that will continue to deliver the expected services without necessarily increasing, renewing or modifying the existing capacity. Key considerations in an operation budget are Personnel costs, admin costs &amp; consumables, and third-party services.\n\nWorking on the Operations Budget raises the question of providing services in-house or outsourcing to an FM company. This is a question that is best addressed on its own merits; but my general advice is that the choice of one over the other will depend on the size, scope or variety of services the asset requires.\n\nIf the in-house option best suits the circumstances, then during the budgeting process, you will have to look at the salary and emoluments of the staff members engaged in the facility management duties and compute the costs for the budget year or period.\n\nThe second line under the Operations Budget is the tools and equipment that they will use. There are two categories of tools and equipment. There are Management Tools like laptops, telephone etc and operational tools and equipment like toolbox. Consumables refer to items that run down in the course of usage – brooms for cleaners, washing liquid, toilet roll. Generator servicing parts like filter are also involved.  These sounds mundane but there are clear examples of even Grade ‘A’ office complexes without toilet roll or hand wash soap in their washrooms.\n\nThird Party Services are items that you have to call specialist companies for.  Generator maintenance, Refuse collection, Swimming pool maintenance, Lift maintenance and so forth. It is advisable to sign a service contract and on that basis, you factor in the costs into the budget.\n\nIf you outsource the facility management function, the process is relatively easier as the FM Company will come up with the budget.  Typically, the FM Company’s budget highlights the various services and their costs but power is separated from these into its own category.\n\nMany of these services are the planned services – like security, cleaning, swimming pool maintenance etc and as the name implies, planned services should be quite certain – you can see and plan ahead. Note however that provision should also be made for unplanned breakdowns. For instance, it is impossible to predict when a door handle will malfunction or a pump will break down. So, we advise that about 20% of the planned budget be set aside as provisional sum for unplanned activities.\n\nIt is very important that the FM Company and the owner agree on this because when the unplanned events occur, each party will be looking to the other to finance the repairs.  Another point to note is that the Landlord\/Investor should also add into the budget, the cost of his own staff who will be the liaison with the FM Company.\n\n<em>In the next segment of the article, we will be looking at the capital budget and the best practice in the industry when budgeting for power for real estate assets.

At the extreme, he can install the flooring he likes (subject to the Landlord’s approval) but generally he would have to leave this when the tenancy comes to an end. Or he could just put temporary covering like carpeting or rugs.\n\nA more beautiful and satisfying way out, especially if you like wood flooring (who doesn’t!) is to install laminate wood flooring.  According to Jabisod Agencies, this type of flooring can be laid on any other floors easily. And it can be removed easily at the end of the lease because removing the tongue and groove in the laminate flooring locks and clips is not difficult. There will be no damage to the Landlord’s floor. The best deal of is that the same floor can be re-laid in another apartment the tenant moves to.","post_title":"Tenants can install their floors….and take them away!","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"draft","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-04-24 15:18:42","post_modified_gmt":"2019-04-24 15:18:42","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=61584","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

He had a busy company to run and had virtually no building experience. Yet he was able to project manage the completion of a beautiful 4 bedroom house in Lekki. Olayinka Olalere spoke with a plucky Lagosian, Mr Niran Ladepo, whom to save cost decided to build his own house.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>What informed your decision to build by yourself?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was living on the mainland with my family and we wanted to move to the island.  The challenge was that we could not afford to buy a house. This was 15 years ago when there were not many developments or people developing houses for sale, so to move to the island meant I had to develop the house that I wanted. So it is a combination of two things. There were not so many developers then so there wasn't a market to buy a finished house and then secondly, even if there was, we could not afford it at that time so I decided to build.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Did you have previous experience building or overseeing a construction project?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a very young man in 1990, I was 21 years old. My father was building his house in Gbagada and to a limited extent, I was involved.  I was there when they were drawing up the plans and engaging the builder, and I spent some time on the site a few days in a month. Subsequently, I worked in the admin department of a building construction company. I would not say I had any technical knowledge as such, but if you ask me for my background in building, I would give these two instances.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>How were you able to control the construction workers?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a cousin who is an architect so I went to her to help with the design. I was able to contribute a bit and I was also very careful to tell her that we didn't want any excessive or convoluted design that will be difficult to build. When we were finished with the design, she introduced me to a contractor. It was supposed to be a contractor type thing where I pay in stages. By the time we got to the foundation, the contractor was having financial problems and eventually, he had to leave to go to Ireland. We were then faced with the challenge of building. We had a quantity surveyor who recommended another builder but this time, we didn't want a contractor type agreement because I wanted to be more involved in the project. The builder hired the labour. He controlled the labourers, artisans and subcontractors.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Did you also buy the building materials yourself and how did you deal with the pricing?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where I think if you are someone who is passionate about a project, you are more likely to research and ask a lot of questions. We stopped by other ongoing projects to ask questions. It was a combination of asking others and actually going to the market to price that saw us through. We did rely on the building contractor who was a very experienced fellow. We investigated extensively and we talked to our friends that are in the industry, and by and large, we were able to get away with it and I think got the building in on time and within budget. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>What problems did you encounter and how did you solve them?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was the challenge of accessing the site, the property is in Lekki phase 1 and then all the roads were not well done. So for a very long time, access to the site was a problem. Vehicles would get stuck in the mud. The roads were non-existent, the drains were non-existent. During the rainy season, there was flooding that would come up to the windows of the car, it was a challenge to get materials to the site. <\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other problem was time. I work for myself and my wife works for a bank but what I can just tell others is that once you’re having a building project your mind goes to it all the time. You wake up in the morning, that’s what you think about. There were days my wife went to the site well before she went to work. On some days, I could not resist going back during the day even with traffic to see what was going on.  <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also were worried about the structural stability of the building. What we did was we got a structural engineering firm that would come when there was any structural work being done. So we knew that at the end of the day we did not get a building that was structurally defective in any way because there is a check on the building contractors. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, the usual problem of finance. You had to find the money. But when you are building, there is a kind of push that comes to you such that you don’t do any frivolous thing, all your money goes towards your project because it tops your priorities. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Did you have professional friends to call on?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We had professional friends but in fact, we employed them. The electrical and mechanical contractor was my personal friend. We employed him according to the right specifications and directives. I was in the building community of my church and so I got the Quantity Surveyor for the church to be our Quantity Surveyor.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Was your authority ever undermined as a novice?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consultant we got to do the work was now supposed to come up with the plan of where things would go. So when I looked at the plans I was particularly upset that he put an air conditioner in almost every considerable spot even in the boys quarters and in almost every part of the house. I cancelled about two or three in the living room which is very cool till today without those additional air conditioners. I asked why that would be and he said we may want to use it for one thing or the other. I think that is something he should have spoken to me about. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also had a falling out with the Quantity Surveyor because when it came to decking we used the hollow clay pot type of decking and I asked him to give us how many hollow clay pots we needed to buy. He did a length and breadth calculation and gave me a number. With the hollow clay pot decking, there are places called ribs where the reinforcements should be and there is also a space in the decking for the stairwell. If you use length and breadth and you do not calculate all these extra spaces, you overbuy because those spaces were not going to be covered by the hollow clay pots. He just did length and breadth and in the end, I was stuck with 25% extra.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think once a lot of professionals accept that you are not a novice, that you are not totally bereft of sense, you can work well with them.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Did building by yourself save cost?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would have because looking back now at what we spent if we had a developer who built for us and we bought from him, I would assume that we would have spent easily anything from 30% to 50% more and that would have meant at one single go. I know that we saved money but it would be difficult to compare because we did not have a developed building to compare with. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Would you do it again if you had to?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I would definitely. Although now I would actually look at the options. If it is a personal house, I would not hesitate to build again. It is a fascinating process. It is stressful but you know that this is possibly your largest investment in one particular place, so it is definitely worth the stress.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you for your time. That would be all.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Trial and Error; the Layman’s Journey to Self Building ","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"draft","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-07-21 11:59:07","post_modified_gmt":"2019-07-21 11:59:07","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=69832","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Formulating the development strategy is a long process and includes site selection and feasibility analysis, the creation of the project pro forma, and an in-depth analysis of the project appraisal and several processes of obtaining of obtaining a construction loan.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Important Definitions about Development Strategy<\/strong>\r\nThese definitions set the framework for the respective roles of various players in the development process:\r\n\r\n<strong>a ) Developer<\/strong>\r\nAn individual, firm, or entity that locates and secures control of a parcel of land, conceives and appropriate project to be built on that land and obtains the needed regulatory approval for that project. The developer typically provides the seed capital necessary to get a project to the point where all the development rights are vested. This amount is often several percentage points of forecasted value of a project; that is a hundred million project can easily require several hundred thousands of naira to be fully permitted and quite possibly substantial additional funds. These funds are usually reimbursed at the start of the construction or at the close of the construction loan by the investor providing the equity for the project. The developer also usually receives a “promote” or return for the time he has invested and risk he has taken in putting together or promoting the project.\r\n\r\n<strong>b ) Builder<\/strong>\r\nThe general contractor who does the actual construction of a project, generally by bidding the job out to a variety of subcontractors. The builder must “ bond ” a project , that is , provide assurances from a third party insurer, guarantor, or surety that the builder will provide the funds to finish the project for the contracted price if the builder does not perform as agreed. The contract may be cost plus a fee or fixed price\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>c ) Investor ( owner)<\/strong>\r\nAn individual, firm or other entity that provides the equity capital necessary to build a project. Frequently investors do not commit themselves until the project is fully vested with development rights. The investor must often assume personal or corporate liability for the construction loan.\r\n\r\n<strong>d ) Lender<\/strong>\r\nAn individual, firm or other entity that provides the debt capital necessary to build the project. The lender will not commit until the project is fully vested with development rights.\r\n\r\n<strong>e ) Property Manager<\/strong>\r\nTypically, an individual, firm or other entity who handles property\/facility management once the project is completed and who also may handle the marketing and management of the lease-up and stabilization phase of the project.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. The Concept: Product Identification and Establishment of Criteria<\/strong>\r\nMost developers tend to specialize within a particular sector of development e.g office complex, strip malls, industrial warehouse, residential communities, high rise. Even within a particular sector, there is a tendency to further sub specialization. The selection of a development concept, product identification, and establishment of development criteria are often a matter of strategic pre-selection based on the developers prior tract record and the company ’ s chosen focus. Although some expansion is normal and even expected – that is, into an adjacent state or subsector— a developer choosing to stray too far from his field of expertise will find it more difficult to attract debt and equity capital.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Seed Capital and Assembling the Team<\/strong>\r\nMost developers have existing sources of seed capital, internal or external, that can be tapped for projects. Almost as a matter of definition, a developer without access to some sort of capital is not a developer. Most experienced developers also have a well-vetted team, both internally and externally, with whom they have worked over the years. In that case, assembling the team may be as simple as gathering the veterans of prior developments together and reviewing the development criteria, alerting them to block out time on their work schedule as appropriate, and receiving feedback as to changing market or regulatory conditions.\r\nIf a developer is venturing into a new market or sector he may choose to assemble a new team with experience in that area. There are many ways to find out who the respected professional are in any given area.\r\nAppraisers, real estate brokers, title companies and real estate lawyers are good sources of information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>4.Market Area Identification<\/strong>\r\nAn interesting question is raised as to which is better: a fantastic site ( great visibility, choice demographics, excellent drive-by traffic ) in a so-so market ( mediocre occupancy, slightly below average rent etc) or a so-so site ( nearby power lines, bad sight lines, questionable surrounding area ) in a fantastic market ( robust rent growth, booming economy, tight and raising occupancy) .\r\nUnless there is a reason to believe that the so-so market conditions are permanent rather than just a phase in a normal business or real estate cycle), choosing the best site over the best market is the prevailing choice, in theory, because markets recover but site cannot move. Although the theory is a simplification, in that the factors that make a site great can change (traffic patterns evolve and demographics are not set in stone), site characteristics do tend to be more stable than market conditions.\r\nEvery developer produces a product or service designed to meet a particular need. To improve one ’ s chances, it is wise to select a market that is not already saturated by competition, a market that needs a product that can be produced at a competitive price with a good quality and workmanship, a market that shows signs of future growth and improvement. A good indication of current market needs can be found by determining the present vacancy rate, current construction activity, and forecast of growth in demand\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>5.Land Acquisition: Optioning the Land, Securing Control<\/strong>\r\nAfter initial investigations indicate that there is a reasonable probability of success for the proposed project on a given site, several important steps must be taken. The land on which to construct the project must be secured, regulatory approvals must be obtained, and capital commitments for both the equity and debt portions of the financing must be received.\r\nIt’s advisable for developers to gain control of the land via an option to purchase the land.\r\nAn option to purchase is the right, for a limited period of time, to purchase the land at an agreed upon price and terms. This option minimizes the loss of capital if for any reason construction does not go forward. More than one project has been stymied because of last-minute regulatory issue, interest rate hike, construction cost jump, or other market change.\r\nOptions may be structured in as many ways as a creative developer or his lawyer can devise, but frequently there is an up-front monetary payment and additional monthly payments. These may or may not be applied to the purchased land. Often a landowner will give a reputable developer a free, 45-to-90-day “ look see ”; that is, the developer puts soft capital ( refundable) to show good, marketable title with no undisclosed defects or quiet partners who might surface are the last moment with additional complications\r\nConversations should be conducted with the appropriate planning officials to discuss the viability of the proposed projects from a regulatory point of view. The option should include full rights to go onto the property, conduct studies ( environmental audits, etc ), do tests ( soil borings, etc ) and generally do further due diligence relating to permits necessary for developments.\r\nIn hot markets or for a top grade site, a land owner may adopt a take-it-or leave it approach and insist on immediate purchase. In that case, the initiative and advantage lies with the developer who has access to ready capital and whose local market knowledge makes him plunge prior to full vesting of all development rights.\r\nSometimes a landowner is willing to contribute her land in return for an interest in the development or provide a long term lease. Such a lease would have to convey full development rights, automatically be subordinate to any financing, and typically be for a minimum term of 30 years; 99 –years are not uncommon.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Site Approvals and Building Permit<\/strong>\r\nOnce the proper land use designation and zoning are clarified, the next step is usually to develop a site plan that shows where the buildings and parking will be located on the site. It generally shows how the developer intends to hook into the necessary utilities ( water, sewer, electricity); comply with various regulations such as building height, lot coverage ratios, floor-area ratio and landscaping and demonstrate compliance with local transportation plans and water management.\r\nThe length of time necessary to obtain a building permit is a critical factor in development. It may take weeks or months between the initial submission of completed plans and the receipt of approval to commence construction.\r\nOften a site-clearing permit or even a foundation permit can be obtained in advance of the full permit, allowing substantial progress to be made and helping a fast track project stay on time.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Construction Financing and Implementation<\/strong>\r\nA developer will find it essential to develop a general familiarity with the financial markets that have the capability to fund such projects. In addition, a developer must develop access to key people within those markets (such as bank officers and mortgage brokers). One or more sources of funding for the project should be located early on, either by sending out preliminary project packages. Potential lenders may respond with a term sheet, non-bidding, highly-qualified letter stating the amount and the terms under which they would lend on the project as presented.\r\nAn investor provides the equity capital necessary for actual construction to aid the debt capital to be secured. The developer usually provides the seed equity necessary to get the project to construction. Investors can be individuals of high net worth, insurance companies, and investment banks. Developers may have established a working relationship with an investor or group of investors. A track record of successes tends to attract a following, and a successful developer may accumulate the funds to make a significant investment in his own projects.\r\nA developer may choose the desired builder early in the process and have that builder work closely with the architect in designing the project, providing ongoing feedback on best construction methods and material. After the design is completed, the financing committed, the land secured, the permits obtained, and decisions reached on any consequential details, the contract is awarded for construction of the project\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBabafemi Awofala is the Founder and Managing Director of Brickstone Partners Limited,\r\nAn integrated professional service firm providing project finance advisory and transaction\r\nstructuring for the energy, infrastructure and real estate industry in West Africa. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brickstone-partners.com\/\">www.brickstone-partners.com<\/a>Mobile 08051262691 Email: hello@brickstone-partners.com\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Choosing a Real Estate Development Strategy","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"choosing-a-real-estate-development-strategy","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 02:28:18","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 02:28:18","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=3557","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

If you are careless the probability of having cracked walls will be high.\r\nThese amongst others are the causes and how to avoid them-\r\n\r\n(1)Wrong block moulding mixture-Cement and sand mixture for sand needs to be properly checked which is usually between 1:6 to 1:8 depends on types of constituents.\r\nVery good mixture for a 9” block will produce 30 pieces worst it should not exceed 50 on any account.\r\nStone dust are also added in a proportion to give a stronger block, trying to save cost by using inadequate cement, sand ratio will weaken your walls and can lead to cracks.\r\n\r\n(2)Wrong cement mortar mixture-Mortar is what you use as the bond between one block and the other, the blocks are expected to be adequately bonded by the mortar, if this is weak it can also affect the block and can lead to cracking.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n(3)Wrong laying pattern-Blocks should be set on each other in herringbone manner see diagram——\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-3584 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/d1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"304\" height=\"244\" \/><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3585 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/d2-300x241.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"241\" \/>Laying the edge of one block on another causes cracking along the mortar line when is not broken by locking it up with other blocks, The vertical mortar line is the weakest point and should be broken by walls, straight line from top to bottom will cause cracking.\r\n\r\n(4)Weak Foundation- Weak foundation causes unusual settlements and movements on foundation that will ultimately affects the blockwalls on top, this surely will cause cracks from foundation through the walls . Cracks could be horizontal or vertical, the horizontal requires serious structural remedy because that may be due to uneven settlements.\r\n\r\n(5) P’lumbness’ or straightness when laying your blocks can also adversely affect the blockwork especially when is terribly done.\r\n\r\n(6)Boring holes indiscriminately-Electricians and plumbers are major culprits on site when it involves creating holes on block walls. Caution needs to be taken when creating these holes for  scaffolding otherwise you will have crack walls or you can go for total free standing scaffolds.\r\n\r\n(7)Long, successive horizontal and vertical blockworks without concrete breaks- laying blocks on each other with any height beyond 3.6m without a corresponding concrete break will create pressure on blockwalls which can also cause cracking especially when the blocks are not strong and loadbearing.\r\n\r\n(8)Wet blocks-Blocks are supposed to be left to dry and strong before usage, usually it takes minimum of 48 hours to cure, using blocks under 24 hours is not advisable and it leads to cracking.\r\n\r\n(9) Mishandling of blocks-Proper care should be taken when blocks are in use.\r\n\r\n(10 )Impurities in mixture-When there are impurities in constituents  that make up the block, expect a weak output which will surely leads to cracking.\r\n\r\n(11) Improper or wrong materials will not help save money but will create problems: for instance using sand gathered from drainage gutter.\r\n\r\n(12) Loosely compacted blocks during moulding will also affect the block, which will lead to cracking.\r\n\r\n(13) Inadequate concrete support incase of load.\r\n\r\n(14) Shrinkage-When you build on a clay soil that contracts and expands. Clay causes movement in foundation and when the foundation is shallow it will affect the blockwall.\r\n\r\n(15) Using fresh blocks\r\n\r\n(16) Using unclean sand with clay just as stated in ‘14’ above,clay contracts when is dried and expands when it is wet: these movements causes cracking.\r\n\r\n(17) Flooding-Areas susceptible to long-term flooding will also experience walls cracking. Water can go underneath foundation, weaken the foundation and cause movements, which will affect the blockwalls and leads to cracking.\r\n\r\n(18) Differential settlements in foundation-Please check to make sure where you are building, the problem of differential settlements does not arise.\r\n\r\n(19) Unevenly compacted fill. When you fill the foundation with laterite but you didn’t ‘rammer’ or compact very well the areas with loose soil will affect the blockwall on top of it and cause cracks.\r\n\r\n(20) When one side settles on rock which can’t have any further settlement with a corresponding soil area that is required to settle, expect cracking of walls especially when the block spans across.\r\n\r\n(21) Poorly designed structure without adequate planning of walls joining each other.\r\n\r\n(22) When you have extremely rich mortar mix, this will also affect block and make it to crack, especially when you want to remove and place elsewhere. It causes wall stiffness; there should be room for the wall to breathe.\r\n\r\n(23) Rapid loading of blockworks-When you have a deadline and you put too many blocks on each other you are most likely to have cracks.\r\n\r\n(24) Removing props or construction supports too early will create tension on the blockwall which can lead to cracks.\r\n\r\n(25) When you have deciduous trees with roots growing underneath the foundation.\r\n\r\n(26) Free standing walls-This is caused by bad designs when you have too many walls not locking with other walls. The isolated walls are likely to crack.\r\n\r\n(27) Rising damp around building.\r\n\r\n(28) Poor drainage will make water gather around building which will ultimately affect the walls.\r\n\r\n(29) Mining activities around building will cause vibration and affects the wall which can cause cracking especially when it involves blasting of rocks etc with explosives.\r\n\r\n(30) Very short lintel (concrete) on top of windows, doors and other openings will affect the surrounding blocks and cause cracks.\r\n\r\n(32)  No oversite concrete or german floor.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Causes and How to avoid cracks when laying blocks","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"causes-and-how-to-avoid-cracks-when-laying-blocks","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 02:27:49","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 02:27:49","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=3580","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Now it is time to put up that mansion that you have always envisaged.  A room for every family member and the family dog is in order. What about a room for the grandchildren that will come in future? Now that the bedrooms, all en-suite of course have been sorted out what about the living areas? There’s the formal parlous, the family living room up-stairs and surely there must be an ante room to receive such callers like the mechanics etc. who cannot be invited into the main sitting room. There’s also the small matter of political ambitions so there must be another parlour where to level consultations with ‘my people’ can be held in secrecy. Apart from the living areas there is also the prayer room, the study and the gym where <em>Oga <\/em>can do a few rounds on the tread.\r\n\r\nIn the meeting with his architect, the owner of this castle can probably justify why he has to have a mansion with so many rooms. Many years down the road when the cost of maintaining it is over bearing or the owner has passed on and the children are saddled with the property, the sagacity of putting up the humongous structure is in doubt. Now it is difficult to sell or rent it and none of the children want to live there. Speaking with several agents who advertised such grand family homes, we find that such properties can be on the market for upwards of two years or more but still cannot find buyers.\r\n\r\nWith this hindsight one would have thought that such overbuilding would have died out but while most modern Nigerians would claim that they do not believe in big houses, let a few millions of Naira hit their bank balances and voila a 13-room castle is built. If you really must have that grand house, do go ahead but instruct your architect to design it in such a way that it can be divided into various apartments with few modifications and no structural work required. So the ten bedroom house can be converted into four nos 2 bedroom flats or two nos 4 bedroom semi-detached houses.

This week, we look at one of the roles the private sector can play to make housing affordable.\r\n\r\nThe term affordable housing is defined and described in various ways depending on who’s doing the narration and where. But UN-Habitat broadly defines affordable housing as “that which is reasonably adequate in standard and location for a lower- and middle-income occupant(s) and does not cost so much that it prohibits the occupant(s) meeting other basic living costs or threaten their enjoyment of basic human rights.” This definition is widely accepted and quoted; partly because the definition resonates with the average listener as a fair depiction of the concept.\r\n\r\nLooking carefully at this description, a few inferences can be drawn. Firstly, affordable housing doesn’t infer strictly sub-standard houses in remote locations. That a house is affordable does not mean it has to be the worst house available on the market. Secondly, affordable housing is very cost-centric, seeking out homes for less than average market value. It is this that actually defines a house as being affordable – price. The price has to be right enough to ensure the occupant can meet other basic living costs and enjoy basic human rights life has to offer.\r\n\r\nIn any business or economic transaction what the receiving party essentially seeks is value for money. You enter a grocery store and exchange a Dollar bill for a Snickers bar; you expect to receive a packaged snack with milk chocolate, crunchy nuts and caramel all flowing in one, anything short of this is a reap off. Value for money can either be by attaining a higher quality level at the same price or receiving the same quality level for less money. Either way, subscribers want an efficient and effective product. A widget that meets objectives using fewer resources, and one that meets objectives sooner.\r\n\r\nThe value for money concept partly describes affordable housing. There is no set price limit that makes a house affordable or not, what is important is that it provides <em>higher <\/em>value for money. This can either be by attaining a higher quality level at lower price or offering the same quality level for much less money than ordinarily available on the market. Simply put – affordable houses give much more value for money than commercially available houses.\r\n\r\nSay an average 3-bed apartment of about 120sqm floor plate in your choice location ordinarily sells for circa $100,000. How would you describe a well-built 3-bed apartment in your choice location that is being offered for $60,000? I guess you would describe it as affordable. Or perhaps a steal! This is because the property offers higher value for money.\r\n\r\nThis goes to show the relativity of affordable housing as a concept. It’s a moving target that varies from location to location and transaction to transaction. Affordable housing developers need to tweak their financing, construction techniques, spatial utilization, labour size amongst others to ensure they can offer a property “which is reasonably adequate in standard and location” for lower price.

Who would be happy for me? Some of my friends who used to struggle for ‘molue’ or public transport with me even declined a free ride. But I knew they did not want to be caught dead in my ‘tokunbo 1998 model Toyota celica.’ I enjoyed my rides alone.\r\n\r\nOn rare occasions however, most especially during the rush hours, on my way from work, I will slow down by a bus-stop and offer to lift some passengers for some company. Turning up their noses in scepticism, some will hop in; others will say something like, ‘you wan enter one chance.’ I would laugh and say to me, ‘you just missed out of your only chance to get home earlier and zoom off. I never stop to pick up a chic, even if she appears stranded. First impression matters a lot, my first car gives a bad one.\r\n\r\nI am a youthful and virile man, and that is no exaggeration.I have abs, as in six packs, strong facial features, above average height at 6’1, na condition make crayfish bend inside jalopy. Beyond that my small modelling job that I do at the side is beginning to pay off. And that is how I came about my first car. With my 9-5 job, I could not even afford a bike. My friends are ‘beefing’ my new ride, since they could not afford one.’ It is true our salaries are in the same range, but I am a handsome young man. Don’t hate me, hate my maker!\r\n\r\nI mean, the first day I drove my car home, my landlord was happy for me, he even prayed for me. It did not end there; I ate at dinner with his family that night. He told me keep up at what I was doing. That night, he gave me a parking space behind his bungalow which is just between his place and the BQ I am renting. It was going to be the only car in the compound at that time and I could easily park somewhere else, but I guess he wanted it to be hidden from plain sight. I understood and concurred and we continued living happily ever after.\r\n\r\nMy landlord is a pensioner, at times when I come early enough I would sit with him and his family and we would chat away into the night. He always went on and on about what pensioners go through in this country. How his father who worked in the UK many years ago continued to receive pension until he died even though he retired and returned to Nigeria. Luckily for his family, his wife had built her business well and that is their sustenance now.\r\n\r\nHe was like a father to me, and I respected him a lot, the only thing he frowned against was bringing too many male friends home. He has only daughters and they are all young, mostly teenagers, and I reasoned with him and complied and that made him love me more, or so I thought until the incredible happened.\r\n\r\nI got this fantastic billboard job for a multinational company and the pay was huge, I would not disclose it here for fear of being marked but it was in 7-digits and I decided to shut down the town. Of course I was not bringing my friends home, I rented a hall, a small one though and threw a party. I asked my landlord if his daughters could come. He said of course, but they never showed. What was even more painful, I was locked out. The gate was locked from within. I tried calling him or another member of his family and got no response. I had hinted him that I bought a <em>tear rubber<\/em>(new) car which I would launch at the party. I was eager to come show it to him and get a pat on the back. Sadly, I ended up parking the car outside the compound. I strolled down to a friend’s place, somewhere on the next street and spent the night. The next morning, I got the shocker of my life; my landlord told me I could not park my second car in the compound!\r\n\r\nI went ballistic, was it not bad enough, that he locked me out, the night before? Here I was, the fool, thinking I had a father figure in him; a proud son coming home to show a father his new trophy, and I get a below-the-belt blow. First, he told me he did not approve of my lifestyle: night crawling, womanizing, drunkenness, that he would not risk his daughters getting unwanted pregnancies. I was shocked to my teeth. It was in the same house, we would sit together and chat over a bottle of stout; at times I brought him drinks; at other times, he served me from his treasure trove –his daughter playing waitress. Dumbfounded, I went into my room and sulked for a while but later went to hang out with friends.\r\n\r\nEver since, there has been so much friction between us. I now park my new car outside.I moved my jalopy out as well to avoid any form of confrontations. No more chitchats, we just manage to say hi. His wife never said a word to me about the parking issue; she remained aloof on the matter. And his kids avoid me like a leper. He has brainwashed and turned his whole family against me. I am their only tenant. If there is a notice, bills mostly, they slip it under my door whenever I am not around for me to discover once I return. I got this notice that my rent would expire in three months and that I needed to pay in advance. I used to do that out consideration for him just so he could take care of his family. Not anymore. 90 days to go and I can finally move on to better things. If I get a new modelling job, I could rent a nice place where I would be by myself, better still, I am looking for where I can buy land in my income range. I hooked on Castle’s Magazine for the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3611\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\"]<img class=\"wp-image-3611 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/t1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"230\" \/> Landlord[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong><em><u>Landlord:<\/u><\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\nBoys of nowadays, what do they know about life or delaying gratification.

In relation to Real Estate, it is usually described as a pipe, tube or trough for protection of electric wires or cables. Conduits protect the occupiers from direct contact with wiring and cabling whilst also protecting the wires and cables from being tampered with by unqualified persons.\r\n\r\nIn the last few months, we have discovered shocking uses for conduits as channels for the flow of illicit monies. Our security agencies have discovered stock piles of currencies lodged in buildings scattered across the country. False walls, Conduits, Sewage treatments tanks, basements, farms, forests, and cemeteries are competing with bank vaults for secret storage of, in this scenario, illicit and illegitimate monies.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Money Laundering and Resultant Effect on Real Estate Market Values.<\/strong><\/span>\r\nMarket valuation of real estate in Nigeria is a true paradox when comparing to values of real estate globally. It conflicts with the accepted drivers of real estate growth which are among others, Infrastructure&amp; Amenities, Contribution to GDP, Inclusive Housing Finance, Mortgage Re-financing, REITS, REICOs,Sound Zoning and Planning Laws, Effective Land Registration System, Effective Administration of Justice and Access to Affordable Housing which drives up demand.\r\n\r\nReal Estate growth in developed economies which have developed effective systems for observing and measuring real estate growth through transactional market and data intelligence boasts of 6-8% ROI especially as inflationary rates are below 3%. I attended a Foreign Property Investment Forum in London and the “sheer excitement” amongst prospective property investors of 6% growth rates left be deflated and bewilderedie “6% pere??. The Lagos Real Estate Market boasts of yearly average growth rates of 16-20% pa with no true basis or drivers for such growth. Real Estate contributes nominally if at all to the country’s GDP, there is a huge deficit of housing stock and where such housing stock exist, demand is highly ineffective. 80% of legitimate income earners are fenced off the buying market buttressing the report from Nigerian Deposit Insurance Company which revealed that 90% of total deposits in Nigerian Banks are owned by 2% of Nigerians.\r\n\r\nSo who is buying up real estate in Nigeria particularly in Lagos &amp; Abuja?? Your guess is as good as mine. Illicit monies circling around the financial system is laundered into Real Estate. Please picture an image of a high speed Samsung Washing Machine laundering your clothes, that’s how the monies spin through the swanky edifices and buildings seen around our high-brow locations. So a disclaimer before I continue, there are pockets of developments financed by legitimate monies at very uncompetitive lending terms, foreign direct investment in retail and office developments or perhaps capital or profits from legitimate business invested in real estate developments. Majority of developments of this nature are somewhat competitively priced and are easily snapped up corporates, the upper-middle class whose income can accommodate our double digit mortgage rates and\/or whose employers can finance such purchases at low lending rates.\r\n\r\nBack to Illicit Monies-This is generated illegitimately from capital projects and transactions in the public and private sectors. In the public sector it is diversion of public funds by those in position of authority or beneficiaries of such funds given the responsibility and obligation to execute social projects and thereafter breach such obligations with little or no consequence usually in connivance with public sector officials.\r\n\r\nThe said funds find conduits, channels, fluidity in real estate where they are “invested” with little or no requirement for immediate financial returns. It is a safe haven, A Panama or Mauritius until the need for such returns are required particularly when tenure of office expires or should I say when the gravy train comes to a final stop.\r\n\r\nSo the cancerous effect of corruption-funded real estate growth is such that it drives up the value of real estate in unconventional ways namely Vendor A who sells real estate to Purchaser A at such an astronomical value has wet the appetite of Vendor B of similar real estate holdings who would anticipate such inflows. Vendor B would rather wait it out till he locates his beautiful bride, Purchaser B. The actions of Vendor A\/B and thought process of Purchaser B ring fences legitimate income earners from accessing the market. Reluctantly there is a large supply of “luxury” without the corresponding demand. The 2016 Vacancy Factor Index released by Financial Derivatives Ltd and RAC’s Housing Price Index for Ikoyi and Victoria Island are at a 72% high with no major variation or deviation till date.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nParadoxically Lagos as a commercial and trade West African hub should ordinarily attract high investor interests from other jurisdictions similarly to London, New York, Johannesburg etc. However the real drivers for real estate growth as I earlier mentioned simply do not exist and savvy investors realise this growth is corruption driven and highly unsustainable. This also accounts for the lack of foreign direct investment into residential real estate market unlike sectors such Telecommunications, Oil and Gas, Financial Services despite the 17million housing deficit figures.\r\n\r\nA possible solution to stem the flow of illicit monies into real estate is a Property Transaction Register. This is not the same as the Lands Register found in State Land Registries. The requirement for registration is not mandatory and many owners of real estate bye-pass registration with changes in ownership conducted in the absence of registration. Identities of purchasers of real estate should be disclosed in the same way income must be commensurate to purchasing power. Since the proverbial manna no longer falls from heaven, one can only fund real estate purchases from earnings, inheritance or institutional financing.This property registration should be structured as a seamless technology driven process without the usual bureaucratic red tape. It should be mandatory but with incentives for registering such transactions to drive participation and inclusiveness. More so promoters of institutional purchasers such as companies, NGOs and other corporate bodies should also be revealed. Primarily it can provide state governments with transactional data on real estate trading with reliance on such data to develop policies to boost the markets. For purposes of stemming money laundering in real estate it can assist investigations when trying to identify suspicious flow of illicit monies and those in control of companies owing real estate assets.\r\n\r\nIt would be welcoming if real estate stakeholders can generate more solutions and ideas to curb the flow of illicit funds into real estate in order to create a sustainable, data-driven and investor-friendly real estate market. Real estate must be exchanged for real value. Our Conduits should contain wiring and cables not currency.\r\n\r\nOmorinsolaIpaye (morinsola.ipaye@kparkwoodproperties.com)\r\nReal Estate Professional, Legal Advisor and Good Governance Advocate\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Currencies in Conduits","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"currencies-in-conduits","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 02:27:08","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 02:27:08","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5025","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Most people with spare income make it their first port of call for investment, however, we realized that most people don’t really know when their property investment is a good investment, as they are fixated on the difference between the price they bought and sold, whilst ignoring all the frictional costs in between. We thought this topic was worth looking into.\r\n\r\nTypically, an investment is anything that gives you more money out than you put in, and the holistic way to look at this when it comes to properties is to look at the total return the property generates. Total return consists of two things, Capital Appreciation and Yield gained during ownership. However, every investor has a different motive for investing, and what they would call a win.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome people look for cash cows that can hold value, others are looking for a lump sum at some point in the future, whilst others are looking for an income generating opportunity. So these would all have different conceptions of value. For the latter individual, their perception of a good yield would be what comes in at the end of every month.\r\n\r\nThe path, however, isn’t necessarily that straightforward. The first thing people forget to tack on to their considerations is outlay. Properties require servicing costs for many reasons. For instance, some apartments have service charges equivalent to 1 - 3 months of Income, which is an effective deduction of 25% of your yield. Some properties can even be as bad as 6 - 8 months, especially when major works are going on in the block. As these works can be ongoing for 5 - 10 years. Costs of some major works can be the equivalent of 4 years of rental income.\r\n\r\nIf we are to speak in numbers to help visualization, some buildings have service charges of about £20,000, with the excess sinking fund being set apart in anticipation of major works. So this is clearly something to factor in when considering what property to buy. What is useful in an end user home, such as a swimming pool, gym, and concierge, may never reflect in the rental yield that would be achieved on the property investment. As all those things drive up cost markedly.\r\n\r\nTo quickly address an alternate perspective, some pay for major works and sell before they are able to see the upswing in value to be gained from such works on their property. This is likewise an undesirable position. People who want to benefit now must be conscious of building plans, as these maintenance works aren’t done spontaneously, there have to be long-term plans in place.\r\n\r\nHigh service charges aren’t universal, small blocks and ex-council flats, for instance, have typically low service charges. However, if there are major works in ex-council flats, you bear a disproportionate cost to other residents who aren’t private owners, as their costs are absorbed by the council while the freeholder passes a proportion of costs to private owners.\r\n\r\nWe’ve expended a lot of energy on discussing service charges, but there are many more things to consider, such as Capital Gains tax, repair costs, Title renewal etc. So with all this to consider, when is a property investment really a good return? Is it when you sell? Is it what you believe it’s value is?\r\n\r\nTo quote a client Who bought a home in 1974 for £75,000 and had it valued at over £4m, “ I feel good about the capital appreciation but I still need a roof over my head”. An increase in valuation may be great from an emotional perspective, but one still needs to live in that home.\r\n\r\nWe’ve seen MiFID II requirements in European banking, an attempt to ensure fairer, safer and more efficient markets and facilitate greater transparency for all participants. This has forced asset and wealth managers to be more transparent with fees charged during investment, giving investors a clearer picture of how much they make from their investments and how much is lost to frictional costs and fees.\r\n\r\nWe feel first and foremost, that a property investment is best when you are making an income. This is because the costs are high and indeterminate, but as with all things, awareness shifts the balance in your favor, first by influencing what you buy and how you structure your investment, and secondly by factoring in this costs into the price paid, the appreciation expected and the yield sought.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Proper Accounting for your London Property Investment","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"proper-accounting-for-your-london-property-investment","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 14:09:23","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 14:09:23","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5037","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The new law sought to give tenants further protection from landlords than what existing at the time.\r\n\r\nMr Fashola, was particularly incensed that landlords demanded two years rent in advance from workers who were paid monthly. And so the clause, which attracted the most attention, was one that restricted the landlord from demanding rents for long periods, in advance. Indeed, Section 4 (3), (4) and (5) stipulates that it is a crime that landlords should demand or tenants pay more than one year’s rent.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>(3) It shall be unlawful for a landlord or his agent to demand or receive from a new or would be tenant rent in excess of one (1) year in respect of any premises.\r\n(4) It shall be unlawful for a new or would be tenant to offer or pay rent in excess of one (1) year in respect of any premises.\r\n(5) Any person who receives or pays rent in excess of what is prescribed in this Section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of One Hundred Thousand Naira (N100,000.00) or to three (3) months imprisonment<\/em>\r\n\r\nAside from the contentious issue of advance rents, the Law protected the tenant form overbearing landlords who seek to curtail the tenant’s use of rented premises. The tenant is entitled to quiet and peaceable enjoyment of the premises, including the right to privacy; freedom from unreasonable disturbance; exclusive possession of the premises, subject to the landlord's restricted right of inspection; and the use of common areas for reasonable and lawful purpose. Where a tenant with the previous consent in writing of the landlord, effects improvements on the premises and the landlord determines the tenancy, such a tenant shall be entitled to claim compensation for the effected improvements on quitting the premises.\r\n\r\nIt is the responsibility of the landlord to effect repairs and maintain the external and common parts of the premises. And when such is done by the tenant upon the landlord's refusal, such tenant has a right to claim compensation as to be determined by the law.\r\n\r\nHas the Law changed anything in the Landlord\/Tenant relationship in Lagos State over the last 6 years? The Law Reform Committee of the Lagos State Government is asking stakeholders and members of the public for their views on the efficacy of the Law. CASTLES Lifestyle took the opportunity to ask several real estate practitioners if, indeed, tenants are better protected.\r\n\r\nThe unanimous view of the practitioners was that, the rental market reacts to the forces of demand and supply. In locations like Apapa GRA, Ikoyi and Victoria Island, which are exempted from the 1 year advance payment law, tenants pay only one year in advance. This is because there is more supply than demand in these areas. On the other hand, in areas like Ilupeju and Surulere, where there is more demand than supply, tenants routinely pay two years rent in advance at the commencement of their tenancies. They revert to paying a year’s rent after the initial period. This is done causally and routinely with neither party paying heed to the ‘crime’ they are committing.\r\n\r\nApart from advance payment of rent, the Law is observed mainly in the breach. Especially as many of the stakeholders themselves, not to talk of the general public, are unaware of many provisions of the Law. For instance, the Law stipulates that the Tenant is not to pay the legal fees of the landlord in the rental transaction. All the real estate practitioners (ten in number) we spoke with were unaware of that section of the law. Legal fees are routinely stated to be paid by the tenant in tenancy offer letters. So it appears that business in the rental market, has carried on as before with the Law’s impact lost because of commercial considerations.\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"568\">LAW REFORM COMMITTEE CALL FOR MEMORANDA\r\n\r\nInterested in submitting Memoranda to the Law Reform Committee?

There may be luxury flats in Ikoyi, Victoria Island and Lekki but our flat in Ikeja beats them all by far. It is not really a flat, more like an extension to the main house which is inhabited by our genial easy going Landlord and his equally delightful wife. The apartment is on two floors - the ground floor has the kitchen, living room and store and upstairs are two lovely ensuite rooms. It was meant to be an apartment for the land lord's son but the boy refused to move back home after his degree overseas.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nEverything about the apartment is superb. The rent is well below market price as the landlord is ‎more interested in the quality of the tenant than market rent.

Even though the rent is quite low, there was a time I was out of work for three years and could not pay it. I asked Okey to join me. He would pay ‎the full rent and I was to pay half of the rent when I got a job. Luckily three months ago I found a job and was looking forward to the time I would have saved enough to pay Okey back.\r\n\r\nThen Okey landed what appeared to be good news. He had asked his long standing girlfriend to marry him when he heard that she was pregnant. She said yes. I was very happy for them.‎ I had put marriage on hold due to my precarious financial position but with my new job came renewed hope.\r\n\r\nI asked Okey about his plans, fully expecting to be part of them. When did they plan to marry? Where, what kind ‎ of church service would it be? After a while, I noticed that Okey was not looking very happy. What was bothering him? After two days he explained that it was the fact that as he was getting married, I would have to leave the flat. Leave the flat? I was stupefied. What was he talking about? The fact that I had not paid the rent for three years did not mean that it was his flat. He had paid the rent on my behalf. It was a loan.

Guess who she got married to?<\/em>\r\n\r\n<strong><em> <\/em><\/strong>While everyone was recounting his or her experiences with Esther, Madam was getting visibly bored. I summoned up courage to ask her if she was going to do anything about what she heard but she just shrugged and said that everyone was lying against the poor girl. I must admit that if I had not had an experience with Esther, I would have believed Madam, so innocent was the look on Esther's face.\r\n\r\nWe all soon forgot about Esther and her sly ways and went about our own businesses. About two years down the line my rent was due but there was a problem. My company was going through financial difficulties and only half salaries were being paid. I was in trouble. What was uppermost on my mind was my rent- if I could keep a roof over my head and petrol in my tank, I was confident that I could get over this temporary situation.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBy this time, all of us in the block of flats apart from Madam and Esther had become firm friends. Feeling a bit embarrassed to tell Peter and Mary, I went to see Fikayo, the banker. After playing with his son for a few minutes, we went on the terrace and by the time I told him my story, he started telling me his. Apparently, he had given out a few bad loans, some related to shares as well and to cut a long story short, he was not going to be paid until the loans were sorted out. This had been happening for some months. The good news was that when his rent was due, he had appealed to the Landlord who had said that because of a new wife he (the landlord) was going to marry; he was in a good mood and would defer receipt of the loan for up to a year. Great news I thought. The Okeke's came in just as I was leaving and Fikayo called me back. They were coming for a weekly fellowship on financial breakthrough and he believed that in my circumstances I needed it as well. What had happened to the Okekes? Well their pension cheques had been delayed for some reasons (not Esther!), their children abroad could not send money due to the credit crunch, they could not sell their shares and gullible Mr. Okeke had fallen for a 419 artist who had wiped off their savings. I felt blessed just to hear such misery. The fellowship opened with over thirty minutes of praying for the Landlord who had also allowed the Okeke's to stay in the flat also rent free until they could get on their feet. After the fellowship, we discussed further and it was agreed that I should table my case at the wedding which the landlord had invited all the tenants to.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sanusi came to see me that night  since her husband had a stroke and could not drive, she asked if I could drive her to the Landlord's wedding. I tried to remonstrate with her saying that she did not need to go as the Landlord knew of her husband's condition and that she would have to take care of him. She explained that she was not going to fulfill social commitments only but that she needed to ask the Landlord to defer her rent until she could get back on her feet after her husband's unfortunate accident. I agreed that her mission was very important. We all set off for the wedding in a convoy and I remembered thanking God for this wife that was bringing much joy not only to the Landlord but to his tenants as well.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine our shock when we found out that the bride was no other person than Esther, Madam's housemaid. I could not shut my mouth. My eyes met with hers and she gave me a look that I could not comprehend but I knew that my chances of getting a reprieve from our Landlord were almost non existent. My eyes moved to Mrs. Sanusi, the Okeke's and Fikayo. We all had the same expression on our faces  doom. This Esther was certainly not going to save her former co-tenants.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"A modern story of ESTHER (2)","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"a-modern-story-of-esther","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 14:09:08","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 14:09:08","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5818","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

She, my wife and their close circle of friends had all grown up in Ikoyi and Victoria Island. They were daughters of senior Government officials and top corporate executives. They were expected to marry young men from their ‘class’ whose parents had the necessary Island flats to give them upon marriage.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Can’t Lanre manage to pay for a Lekki mini-flat?” Shade persisted. She did not want her confidant to be far away from her. “I can’t just jump in the car and come and see you in Gbagada. The traffic and security issues, you know. You are really brave to make this move”\r\n\r\nThe conversation went back and forth. Shade trying to convince my wife to convince me to get a place on the Island while my wife conscious of my preference was trying to get her off the topic. Eventually, the debate got heated and both of them stormed off. I was bemused to get a text that Shade would no longer be one of my wife’s bridesmaids. I tried to get the reasons for this out of my wife but she said that she did not want to talk about it.\r\n\r\nIt was about ten years later, when we had moved to our own house at Lekki Phase 1 that my wife told me the reason why. Over the years, she had made up with Shade but the relationship was never the same.  I was more amused than annoyed. Sure, I had enough money to rent an ‘Island’ flat but it would have meant eating into my property acquisition fund and I wanted to get rental properties on the Island before even building my own home. That first night as we savoured the blessing of living in our own home as well as two flats in Dolphin Estate, Ikoyi we pondered on the vanity of Nigerian values.\r\n\r\nI was to remember the conversation in three years time. By then, I had sold the Dolphin flats at a nice premium and disposed of some land in the Lekki region which gave a handsome profit. With some financial engineering, I was now the proud owner of two blocks of flats in Parkview Estate, Ikoyi. Eight flats in Ikoyi! No mean feat for the Gbagada boy!\r\n\r\nThat fateful day, my Estate Manager had come to see me with a request from a prospective tenant that she wanted to pay the annual rent in instalments. I was irritated.\r\n\r\n“You know that I don’t accede to such requests. Why are you bothering me?”\r\n\r\nThe Estate Manager said that the woman was insistent that I would want to see her. I was curious. Who could this be?  It turned out to be Shade. She entered the office in a breezy manner as if we were best of friends, telling the Estate Manager in a regal manner to ‘excuse us’. The poor chap out of deference, complied.\r\n\r\nThe long and short of our conversation was that Shade and her ‘Ikoyi-born’ husband needed to rent a flat. She gave a ‘cock and bull’ story about investments tied up in London, getting planning approval for their Banana island plot, the need to be close to their children’s school etc.\r\n\r\nI saw through all the bravado. I had heard that the ‘Ikoyi-born’ husband was waiting for his father to die so he could get his share of the estate but in the meantime was not ready to do any work. What he did not know, was that heard that his old man had put all the money in trust for the grandchildren and the money will not be touched for some decades to come. The whole of Lagos knew about it but him. It was Shade’s job that helped them to keep appearances. They had to move out of the father’s flat because the old man had sold the property.\r\n\r\nWow! This was the worst sort of tenant to have. Keeping up appearances with the Lagos social set meant that the Landlord’s rent was the last to get paid and I could see that Shade was someone who would use her relationship with my wife to be cavalier about rent payment.\r\n\r\nI told her point blank that I don’t deal with my tenants directly. It was left to the Estate Manager. She tried to lecture me on how that was a bad way of doing business. I agreed with her but said that that was my way of doing it and it had worked for me. When she saw I couldn’t be moved, she sauntered out of the office to speak with the Manager. I knew she would not pass the tough screening tests we put prospective tenants through.\r\n\r\nA few years later, we at the grand funeral reception party for her Father-in-law. “How’s that your pokey flat in Parkview?” The tone she gave Parkview Estate was as if the place was in Mowe.\r\n\r\nI grinned and sipped the excellent champagne on offer. The Will would be read soon and expectations would be cut short. She might even saunter back to convince me that she wants to ‘manage’ to rent my flat. I will fob her off to the Estate Manager like I did the last time. Gbagada boys don’t play with their rent money.  Come to think of it, should I still be calling myself a “Gbagada boy’ now that I am living in my own mansion in Banana Island?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Sweet irony of life","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"sweet-irony-of-life-my-detractor-is-now-my-tenant","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 14:09:00","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 14:09:00","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5823","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

This week, we look at one of the roles the government can play to make housing affordable.<\/em>\r\n\r\nLand is very expensive. It amounts to about 25 to 65% of the total cost of developing a single house unit depending on what part of the earth you’re standing. Ironically, land is defined as a free gift of nature. Free, yet so expensive, even when property prices stagnate or reduce, land values seem to always soar.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGovernments in different countries hold varied roles with regards to land management; some own all land, some own a portion while some governments have so liberalised land ownership that they struggle to access the resource.\r\n\r\nBut one thing almost all governments retain is the powers to issue or refuse planning permission for the development of land. Government can use these planning powers to make land less expensive to buyers without reducing the unit price of the land in three distinctly related ways.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Government can make land less expensive by reducing setback and building line requirements. Setbacks refer to the distance that a building is located from its boundaries to the street and to neighbouring properties. Take for illustration a parcel of land measuring 600sqm (30m by 20m) and which costs $1,000 per sqm. This amounts to $600,000. In a country like Nigeria, only about 50% of the land can be developed upon due to the setback laws (averagely). As such utility is only derived from 50% of the land in exchange for a value of $600,000. Should the setbacks be reduced by an additional 25%, 75% of the land gives a higher utility but for the same price. This is the case in the UK and several other European countries where a lot of houses are built without any setbacks between them and 1 or 2 metre front setbacks. This amounts to development on up to 80% of land.\r\n\r\nAgain, governments can reduce the price of land quite similarly by increasing the density of development permissible on plots of land. Where landowners are allowed to develop more than 2 to 3 floors on the average, the cost portion of land to the total development cost diminishes as the development goes higher.\r\n\r\nFinally, most parcels of land have a designated land use class. This may be agricultural, residential, commercial, place of worship etc. While such designations are good for giving order to development in towns and cities, planning laws should not be stagnant but dynamically seek to create a sustainable and serene environment. This may require changing land uses as neighbourhoods become gentrified or renewed. By so doing, Government can make land cheaper by re-zoning the use of land to a more viable use. Often times, different uses would pay different prices for land in a particular location. Dynamic zoning laws often permit the use of land for its highest and best use.\r\n\r\nCheaper in the three scenarios described means to increase the value of the land without a corresponding rise in the price the owner pays for it. Should any or all these ideas be implemented in a developing country, prices may rise initially due to pent up demand, but this will soon fizzle out as the new becomes the norm and property values return to being determined primarily by market forces rather than a dynamic move by the government to stimulate development.\r\n\r\n<strong>By Tayo Odunsi<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Tayo Odunsi is a chartered surveyor and real estate economist.

By doing so, she was able to save her people from destruction. A modern day Esther lived in my compound. She was the Adekunle's housemaid. Like her name sake, she caught the eye of an influential man -  our landlord!<\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI generally consider myself to be an even tempered well adjusted person, but frankly Esther was just plain annoying. When I first came to view the apartment at 14 Oba Street in one of the suburbs of Lagos, I had looked at over twenty apartments and had not seen any place I liked. Honestly, estate agents in Lagos have missed their calling: they should be propaganda Ministers in communist countries because of their ability to call black, white. I had been deceived by so many adverts calling a 1 bedroom apartment with 2 box rooms as three bedrooms that when I got to Oba Street, I was ready to accept anything. The flat was a pleasant surprise; everything was perfect- the rooms were spacious, water was running from the tap, there was enough parking space etc. I immediately wrote a cheque for the agent. As I was leaving the flat after one last look, Esther showed up. I must say that she did not look like a housemaid.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n'Oga, na you wan take this house?' she spoke in heavily accented pidgin English.\r\n\r\nI responded in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nShe made a sound that sounded like something between a sigh and an expletive. I asked what the problem was.\r\n\r\nShe replied 'no problem' in a way that implied that there was a huge problem.\r\n\r\nI waited until the agent left and then questioned her. Apparently there were all kinds of spiritual reasons why no one in their right mind would take the flat. All the women who lived there were barren, all the men suffered economic losses and became destitute, the children who were 'lucky' failed their exams while the others just went mad. I was about to call my bank to stop the cheque when a tenant drove in. I recognized her from church -  she was in the choir.\r\n\r\nEsther noticed that I knew her and did all her best to make me make the call before going over to greet the tenant. I rebuffed her and hailed Sis Mary. She greeted me profusely and when she realised that I had come to take the flat started thanking God that it was someone of like mind that was taking the flat. When I mentioned the spiritual problems of the past occupants, she was puzzled. Past occupants? The flat had been vacant for over 6 years as the Landlord was keeping it for his son who was studying abroad. When it was obvious that the young man was not coming home, the landlord decided to rent out the flat. I looked for Esther but she had disappeared.\r\n\r\nI took me two weeks after moving in to meet face to face it Esther and when I did I gave her a piece of my mind. The noise caught the attention of the other tenants and they came out. Mary, my friend from church and her husband, Segun, Fikayo a young banker whose wife was in London having a baby, the Sanusi's a God fearing couple with two young kids, Mr &amp; Mrs. Okeke a retired couple and a woman simply called Madam.\r\n\r\nMadam was the employer of Esther and she herself had an unsavoury reputation. She did not have a husband but three children with different surnames. Everyone had something bad to say about Esther  she had tried to interfere in the Sanusi's marriage telling Mrs. Sanusi that Mr. Sanusi had the signs of some one with a 'spiritual wife'! The Okeke's had suffered at her hands when their pension cheques disappeared despite being posted and received apparently by them (it took a police hand writing expert to conclude that Esther had signed for the cheques and used fraudulent means to collect the money). Fikayo had received text messages that the baby in his wife's womb wasn't his. He was not able to prove it but it was around the same time that Esther offered to clean his flat for him and while there had suggested the she could 'comfort' him during his wife's absence! It was no coincidence that he had just obtained a promotion from work at the same time. The text messages only stopped when he physically removed Esther from his flat. As for Mary and Peter the fear of Esther was the beginning of wisdom and they kept well clear of her. How did Esther ‘deal’ with all the tenants?

In developing and under-developed countries, they don’t exist. NIMBY is actually an acronym ‘Not In My Back Yard’ used to qualify strong and persistent residents and communities that stand against new developments or redevelopments they believe would adversely impact on their neighbourhoods, property values or businesses. NIMBYs in the UK, US, Canada and Italy have stopped the development of airports, waste management facilities, high speed rails, office blocks and even housing projects in locations they believed would affect residents adversely. Adverse effects include overcrowding, pollution (air, noise, waste etc.), environmental degradation or even unaffordability.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn poorer countries; people seem too busy making ends meet to consider the impacts of private and public activities on their neighbourhoods and eventually homes. The other day when a friend asked me to view a property investment he was considering, the access road was just too narrow than expected even for a poorly planned province in Lagos – Nigeria. When I finally blurted out to understand why the road was irrationally the narrowest cul-de-sac ever, I was pointed to the humongous house built by a former politician that seals the entire street off from the motorway.\r\n\r\nWhile I was yet pondering how irresponsible it was not just for the politician to seal people off from standard accessibility but also for the people for keeping silent, or at least not fighting hard enough to stop the injustice. I then remembered how I myself had ignored the government contractors that periodically abandon the construction of the very road in front of my home. The contractor would often abandon the road construction leaving heaps of rubbles which sometimes prevented access into the driveway.\r\n\r\nA little pride of place, sense of ownership and responsibility is required for sustainable, pleasurable and affordable living. Sometimes a stance needs to be taken – Not In My Back Yard.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, a lot of NIMBYs in developed countries stand against everything this discourse represents – to prevent affordable and social housing. Research shows that high and middle class communities usually have three major concerns about proposed affordable developments; the potential increased crime rates and reduced property values due to the intended affordable development, the imagined behaviour of the future residents and lastly, the physical appearance and type of proposed affordable homes<sup>1, 2<\/sup>. But if the rich and comfortable are willing to stop the poor from coming into their neighbourhoods why are the poor never willing to fight against gentrification and schemes that make their own neighbourhoods too expensive for them to live in.\r\n\r\nOne answer to this is that as low and middle class neighbourhoods grow in demand and values rise, the poor initially feel it’s to their benefit. But really is it? Services, amenities and other requirements for living eventually become too expensive over time and the rational option is to sell and move on. The process of moving out is even faster for renters.\r\n\r\nBut imagine a neighbourhood where existing residents do everything possible to keep property values controlled and affordable, no one would have to move out because of rising prices at least. The community is not only a critical catalyst to the existence of affordable homes but more so to ensuring they remain affordable over time by demanding – Not In My Back Yard against any initiative or economic movement that may inhibit affordability in the short or long run.\r\n\r\n<strong>By Tayo Odunsi<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Tayo Odunsi is a chartered surveyor and real estate economist.

Without this, a typical professional would give up, take the easy road and develop for commercial buyers.\r\n\r\n<em>They have to bother.<\/em>\r\n\r\nBecause very few have the high calling and skill to be affordable housing developers. There are different segments of every market and different providers cater to the different segments. Just imagine if every hotel was a Marriot or Hilton, every restaurant a Jamie Oliver, every clothing shop – Gucci. Travelogde, MacDonalds, Primark and the like, play a very critical role to providing goods and services to the low-end segments of their various markets. Housing is no different and the affordable housing developers need not be less profitable.\r\n\r\n<em>If <\/em><em>you bother? <\/em>\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, affordable housing developers may need to exert twice the effort in a bid to keep costs down but they do not make twice the profit. The will need to go through the rigour of selecting buyers\/occupiers carefully to ensure they are not disposing to speculators. They will have to be experts at construction and financial management at the same time. They will need to do so much more but will not earn much more. The good news however is they will always be in demand. They can be likened to defensive stocks – yields may not be high but they are constant and stable.\r\n\r\n<em>Heart and Head<\/em>\r\n\r\nMany affordable housing developers in developed countries are bankrupt or have been forcefully nationalised. Passion is clearly not enough to be an affordable housing developer. There is good reason why most developers are commercial – the alternative (affordable housing) is no easy fry. In every endeavour, sustainability is paramount and this is where skill comes to play. Unfortunately many socialist-minded entrepreneurs dabble into affordable housing with lots of huff and puff genuinely seeking to disrupt the housing landscape for good. But like a lit candle they are quickly smothered at the arrival of strong winds, as affordable housing requires a blend of both heart and head to be sustainably successful.\r\n\r\n<strong>By Tayo Odunsi<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Tayo Odunsi is a chartered surveyor and real estate economist.

This week, we look at one of the roles the individuals can play to make housing affordable.<\/em>\r\n\r\nOne primary reason we have professional careers is to provide for our needs, the basic three being food, clothing and housing. But the phrase “housing career” does not suggest you should be a career housing practitioner just because housing is so important, but rather that the housing solution for every individual should be progressively dynamic, having a life cycle – quite like a good professional career.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt is important that citizens have a housing career because housing is a capital good that requires a lot of time and financial resource to produce a single unit. Hence, for housing supply to be sustainable, the demand must equally be sustainable. It would take a significantly longer time for the housing deficit of any country to be met where the demand keeps increasing irresponsibly or irrationally.\r\n\r\nA typical professional career starts at entry level; low paying, plain vanilla and with little or no experience required. As the worker progresses, s\/he moves into middle management, becomes more specialist, handling more complex and larger responsibilities which naturally warrants higher remuneration. With exception to family businesses and startups, it would be an anomaly to expect certain magnitudes of responsibility too early in one’s career. In general, job responsibilities and remunerations tend to increase over time in line with social and demographic stratifications.\r\n\r\nHousing demands of the average urban dweller should follow similar patterns. Space and tenure requirements should increase to match the social and demographic stratifications of individuals; otherwise this may lead to unsustainable demand. Young school leavers should ordinarily rent small starter homes, get married into a bigger flat (2 to 3 bedrooms) and transit into a family house (3 to 4 bedrooms) as the couple begin to raise their children. At this stage, they should also be considering a more permanent tenure (ownership) as against renting for mobility when they started out.\r\n\r\nShould every university graduate expect to own his or her own “pad” and every newly wed move into their own family home straight from the altar, this begins to set unrealistic expectations which is not the case in even first world countries. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule and some families and even sovereign states can afford to offer young graduates apartments upon graduating or lavish new couples with 4-bedroom houses as wedding gifts, but such practice is not the norm and cannot be made a standard.\r\n\r\nIn approaching housing affordability and accessibility, it’s important to help people in need of housing understand that they should have a housing career. It’s important they understand housing is both a process and a lifecycle. No individual will always have the same type of housing need all through his\/her life. Early in one’s career, mobility and a low upfront cost is very important and renting small apartments offers this. Later in one’s career stability and space become more paramount and this is when home ownership is the major consideration. Interestingly, at this later stage in life, it is expected that the earning potential of the individual or family is greatly increased considering the earning individuals may have more experience and skill. Also, it is expected that by that time, the individual\/couple has saved up enough to access a mortgage or make an outright purchase.\r\n\r\nAs such, a good number of people do not have to fret too much about housing; they just need to ensure they are at the right stage of their housing career.\r\n\r\n<strong>By Tayo Odunsi<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Tayo Odunsi is a chartered surveyor and real estate economist.

Who would be happy for me? Some of my friends who used to  struggle for ‘molue’ or public transport with me even declined a free ride. But I knew they did not want to be caught dead in my ‘tokunbo 1998 model Toyota celica.’ I enjoyed my rides alone.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn rare occasions however, most especially during the rush hours, on my way from work, I will slow down by a bus-stop and offer to lift some passengers for some company. Turning up their noses in scepticism, some will hop in, others will say something like, ‘you wan enter one chance.’ I would laugh and say to me, ‘you just missed out of your only chance to get home earlier and zoom off.I never stop to pick up a chic, even if she appears stranded. First impression matters a lot, my first car gives a bad one.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI am a youthful and virile man, and that is no exaggeration.I have abs, as in six packs, strong facial features, above average height at 6’1, na condition make crayfish bend inside jalopy. Beyond that my small modelling job that I do at the side is beginning to pay off. And that is how I came about my first car. With my 9-5 job, I could not even afford a bike. My friends are ‘beefing’ my new ride, sincethey could not afford one.’ It is true our salaries are in the same range, but I am a handsome young man. Don’t hate me, hate my maker!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI mean, the first day I drove my car home, my landlord was happy for me, he even prayed for me. It did not end there; I ate at dinner with his family that night. He told me keep up at what I was doing. That night, he gave me a parking space behind his bungalow which is just between his place and the BQ I am renting. It was going to be the only car in the compound at that time and I could easily park somewhere else, but I guess he wanted it to be hidden from plain sight. I understood and concurred and we continued living happily ever after.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy landlord is a pensioner, at times when I come early enough I would sit with him and his family and we would chat away into the night. He always went on and on about what pensioners go through in this country. How his father who worked in the UK many years ago continued to receive pension until he died even though he retired and returned to Nigeria. Luckily for his family, his wife had built her business well and that is their sustenance now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHe was like a father to me, and I respected him a lot, the only thing he frowned against was bringing too many male friends home. He has only daughters and they are all young, mostly teenagers and I reasoned with him and complied and that made him love me more, or so I thought until the incredible happened.\r\n\r\nI got this fantastic billboard job for a multinational company and the pay was huge, I would not disclose it here for fear of being marked but it was in 7 digits and I decided to shut down the town. Of course I was not bringing my friends home, I rented a hall, a small one though and threw a party. I asked my landlord if his daughters could come. He said of course, but they never showed. What was even more painful, I was locked out. The gate was locked from within. I tried calling him or anyother member of his family and got no response. I had hinted him that bought a tear rubber (new) car which I would launch at the party, I was eager to come show it to him and get a pat on the back. Sadly I ended up parking the car outside the compound. I strolled down to a friends’ place, somewhere on the next street and spent the night. The next morning, I got the shocker of my life; my landlord told me I could not park my second car in the compound!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI went ballistic, was it not bad enough, that he locked me out, the night before. Here I am, the fool, thinking I had a father figure in him;a proud son coming home to show a father his new trophy, and I get a below the belt. First he told me he did not approve of my lifestyle: night crawling, womanizing, drunkenness, that he would not risk his daughters getting unwanted pregnancies. I mean I was shocked to my teeth. It was in the same house, we would sit together and chat over a bottle of stout; at times I brought him drinks at other times he served me from his treasure trove, his daughter playing waiteress. Dumbfounded, I went into my room and sulked for a while but later went to hang out with friends.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEver since, there has been so much friction between us. I now park my new car outside.I moved my jalopy out as well to avoid any form of confrontations. No more chitchats, we just manage to say hi. His wife never said a word to me about the parking issue; she remained aloof on the matter. And his kids avoid me like a leper. He has brainwashed and turned his whole family against me. I am their only tenant. If there is a notice, bills mostly, they slip it under my door whenever I am not around for me to discover once I return. I got this notice that my rent would expire in three months and that I needed to pay in advance. I used to do that out consideration for him just so he could take care of his family. Not anymore. 90 days to go and I can finally move on to better things. If I get a new modelling job, I could rent a nice place where I would be by myself, better still, I am looking for where I can buy land in my income range. I hooked on Castle’s Magazine for the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n<strong>Landlord<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5856\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/TENANTS-TALE.-300x161.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"161\" \/>\r\n\r\nBoys of nowadays, what do they know about life or delaying gratification. He made small money and he started flaunting. It is the duties of us elders in the market to ensure that a child’s head is well screwed together. Though he is not my son, he is the son I never had. If he is not cautioned he will blow his life away. Let him park his car outside, the rain will fall and wet it, the sun would shine and dry it. When the colours begin to fade he would realise his asset is depreciating and he would look for where to invest. He would be forced to think. If he is lucky enough, it would occur to him to start building his own place; a place to call his own. If he chooses to be a prodigal son and squanders his money, ‘na him know.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCome to think of it, when I was building my house, I made sacrifices. I opted for cheap land. Friends said to me, “Why would you leave the hustle and bustle of living in the city and move to a place village like Igando? That was 15 years ago, thanks to the Lagos State Government I am living in the city and my house is on major road. Today I drink stout in my own house, but I had to quit many years ago to make allowances for other things.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nShould he decide to pack his things and leave, it is even better for me. I will let out the apartment to another tenant and collect house rent, commission and agreement, I am the landlord and caretaker of my property, and I will ‘chop’ alone. ‘Papa landlord never use car, na omo tenant go come pack two cars inside the compound, no be so.’’ I am a proud father; but tough enough let go of my new found son.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Park Outside The Compound Or Pack Your Pangolo","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"park-outside-the-compound-or-pack-your-pangolo-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 02:18:17","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 02:18:17","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5853","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

This week, we look at one of the roles the private sector can play to make housing affordable.<\/em>\r\n\r\nOne of the major problems of the world is the non-existence of a middle ground with most ideologies. It must be black or white and having grey will be adulteration of both which is not palatable to either party. But what if it could be both white and black. Two men standing on each side of a figure written in the sand may see 6 or 9 depending on what side they stand, but if they move to the middle, they only need to look left and right, and perhaps twist their neck awkwardly to see it’s both 6 and 9. So to truly have the best of middle grounds you only need to know where and when to turn.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDevelopers are the lead catalysts for housing provision. A Developer is the entity that assembles all other parties and requirements necessary to provide homes. For all this effort, they desire and should be compensated very well. On the other hand, housing is a benefit that should be enjoyed by all. Housing should not always be offered to the highest bidder but should be made accessible to the people that need it most.\r\n\r\nFor housing to be sustainably provided to reach those that need it and not speculators, developers must not just stand on either side of commercial or social, but must move to the middle ground and determine under which parameters homes will be built to cater to the highest bidder or highest ‘needer’.\r\n\r\nFully commercial developers sell or let to whoever walks in through the door and pays the highest. In a booming economy, speculators will walk in first and with the most cash, thereby driving prices to a point that is no longer sustainable for even the developers. On the flip side, social developers will attempt to sell to the poorest, the sub-prime and needy. Unfortunately they may not make good enough returns to keep in business and repeat the development cycle long enough to wipe out the housing deficit. This is often the case with Public development corporations that attempt to provide homes at cost or less, the programme is eventually unsustainable and runs out of resources to continue.\r\n\r\nThe Middle is the key. The middle is where private developers with a social mandate develop housing projects for a decent profit and target the acquisition at those that truly need the homes. This two aspects must be carefully curated; the construction and the disposal (sale or lease).\r\n\r\nWhere the construction process is too expensive or wasteful the final product becomes too expensive for the target market. Also, where the target market is not carefully identified, speculators will infiltrate the process, seeking to purchase for cheap a good they will flip in future at higher values. At this point the resolve, resourcefulness and restrictions the Developer has will determine the success of the project. Success being an affordable housing project being delivered to those who need affordable homes to live in.\r\n\r\nThis was the case with Alejandro Aravena – a Chilean Architect and founder of Elemental – a for profit business with a social interest. Alejandro and his team worked creatively within the subsidy budget of a group of 100 families to develop homes for them on a 5,000sqm site in the city centre. Initial conventional design options only allowed for 30 or 62 homes to built on the relatively small site. The final project - Quinta Monroy was a development of 100 row houses with each house covering just 72sqm and with options for incremental development up to an additional 50% area as the finances of each family improved. The project required resolve, resourcefulness and restrictions put in by Elemental to see the feat achieved. The project has received worldwide acclaim and Alejandro winning awards for sustainable construction and the Priktzer Architecture Prize amongst many others.\r\n\r\n<strong>By Tayo Odunsi<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Tayo Odunsi is a chartered surveyor and real estate economist.

This week, we look at one of the roles the government can spearhead to make housing affordable.<\/em>\r\n\r\nSickness and disease illustrate clearly that something is wrong. Disease is a disorder or dysfunction in a part or system of a living thing, humans inclusive. Like the human body, housing delivery is a connected system of different organs and parts. Housing delivery is an interdisciplinary endeavour that requires a myriad of members and groups within a society to be successful. Where one is not functioning properly or at all, the system breaks down with disease.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong> <\/strong>The Institute of Housing and Urban Development Studies, Rotterdam holds there are seven components of a housing delivery system. Each component different but irreplaceable and critical to sustainable housing delivery in any location.\r\n\r\n<strong> <\/strong><em>Authorizations<\/em>\r\n\r\nImagine your favourite professional sport played without a referee or umpire; it would most likely transit from recreation to war. Legal authorities play a critical role in ensuring urban development is planned, equitable and pleasing. They ensure new developments adhere to zoning laws, health and safety legislations and other land use considerations. They also regulate who has access to land and enforce that access.\r\n\r\n<em>Land<\/em>\r\n\r\nLand is not just a physical resource, it confers a legal right that can be exchanged in part, for a period or as security to obtain capital. Land acquisition is the first step to housing provision hence making it a key component of the housing delivery system. According to the Peruvian economist Hernando De Soto, the potency of secure land ownership to attract capital is the key driver that enables first world countries garner capital.\r\n\r\n<em>Infrastructure <\/em>\r\n\r\nHomes need much more than walls, floors, doors, windows and a roof to make them habitable. They also need much more other than internal features like interior design and furniture. For a house to be a home, it needs infrastructure; accessibility via roads, connection to power and water, drainage and a sewage system. Where these are available, housing delivery is less hectic and expensive. Where they do not exist, it’s creates a broken housing system.\r\n\r\n<em>Public Facilities <\/em>\r\n\r\nIn addition to infrastructure, the suitability and quality of houses in any location is primarily determined by the availability and quality of its public facilities. The presence of educational, healthcare, recreational, shopping and other public amenities helps make a house a place for living.\r\n\r\n<em>Labour Force <\/em>\r\n\r\nHouses don’t build themselves, at least not yet. They are built by a blend of intellectual and manual labour. Intellectual labour providers such as Architects, Engineers and Surveyors are integral to the proper and sustainable construction of homes. Equally important are the manual labour providers such as masons, carpenters, bar-benders and labourers who execute the instructions of the intellectual workers.\r\n\r\n<em>Building Materials<\/em>\r\n\r\nAvailability of good building materials at an affordable price and sufficient quantity can sometimes be a challenge. Often times, certain locations are restricted in the type of building materials that can be used due to technology or climate limitations.  This is where the local manufacturing sector must team up with the built environment sector to ensure the best and most affordable materials are made available for affordable and sustainable construction. Often times, these two sectors don’t speak to each other and the result is usually malignant to the housing delivery system.\r\n\r\n<em>Financing<\/em>\r\n\r\nMoney pays for most, if not all of the housing delivery components. The way money is sourced is called financing and this may be broadly classified to either debt or equity. Debt is essentially a loan, which is repaid in full with interest. Equity on the other hand is an investment, which is repaid with profit if the transaction is profitable; otherwise the parties share the loss in proportion to their initial investment or agreed terms. Financing is required to purchase land, construct homes or buy a home that is already constructed. The presence and buoyancy of a housing finance system in a country goes a long way to infer buoyancy of the housing delivery system in that country. In fact, show me a country with a buoyant and well-structured housing finance system and I’ll show you a country with a buoyant and well-structured housing delivery system.\r\n\r\nAs the human eyes differs from the legs, each component stands alone and is even sometimes categorised as a different sector of the economy, but each plays an integral role in the concert of housing delivery.\r\n\r\n<strong>By Tayo Odunsi<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Tayo Odunsi is a chartered surveyor and real estate economist.

This week, we look at one of the roles the government can play to make housing affordable.<\/em>\r\n\r\nHouses are expensive capital goods. The median and average price of a US flat and detached house is $313,500 and $377,700 respectively (US Census, September 2016). That is a lot of money, and is relatively the same story in most parts of the world. Consequently, the average Joe doesn’t pay cash down for a home. Since houses ordinarily come with title deeds, this is mortgaged to secure a loan for the most part the buyer cannot afford.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWith an average paying job and many foreseeable working years to go, a working class fellow should be able to afford a mortgage on a commensurately priced house by simply spreading the payments over a long enough period of time. In most developed countries this is the case, but in developing or underdeveloped nations, it’s not quite so.\r\n\r\nThe World Bank computes mortgage depth of countries as a percentage of the mortgage loans availed in comparison to the country’s GDP. US has a mortgage depth of 75%, UK - 83%, Switzerland - 98% and Denmark a whooping 110%. On the flip side of the spectrum, Ghana, Nigeria, Egypt and Tanzania all have less than 1% mortgage penetration.\r\n\r\nThis is not surprising, as Nigeria for example has an average mortgage-lending rate of 24% per annum. Again the interest charged is also not surprising as banks have to compete for funds with “risk-free” Federal Government bonds which pay as high as 18% as against their European counterparts whose Eurobonds have a negative yield.\r\n\r\nBut irrespective of price; in the Netherlands, which has a mortgage depth of 83%, mortgage loans for first time home buyers is fully tax deductible for up to 30 years. This means that so long as the house you are buying is your first and primary residence, the government will refund your mortgage interest payments from your personal income tax deducted from source and paid by your employer.\r\n\r\nThis immediately makes mortgages cheaper, irrespective of the price (interest) charged by the bank. So assume a Dutch homebuyer pays 40% of his or her income as tax, and earns 1,000 Euros pre-tax, meaning 600 Euros post-tax. If his bank charges the conventional maximum of 30% of disposable income (post-tax income) as mortgage repayment, this would mean he pays 200 Euros in mortgage repayment. This means the 200 Euros paid as a monthly mortgage repayment would be sufficiently fully refunded from his tax. It is therefore “free” to take a mortgage, it would be ridiculous not to do so, all other requirements being met.\r\n\r\nShould this law be enacted in Nigeria where the income tax is about 25% of personal income this would be the statistics. A homebuyer with a post tax income of 150,000 Naira will pay 50,000 Naira in tax. If he is also charged a maximum of 30% of his income in mortgage repayment he will be paying 45,0000 monthly. Consequently, a fully deductible mortgage policy will just adequately refund his mortgage payment.\r\n\r\nThis immediately makes mortgages affordable, if not free to home buyers who can fulfil other conditions such as showing a steady source of income for loan repayment. Now before you jump to the Governments defence on tax loss it will have to bear, note that such loss will be on a steady decline after an initial period of policy hype and then stabilization.\r\n\r\nAs people begin to joyfully take up mortgages for first home purchases, this will create significant competition amongst mortgage providers setting in motion the basic laws of economics. Mortgage prices would have to fall to stay competitive, consequently reducing tax refund obligations of the Government over time.\r\n\r\nIn all, as mortgage prices and tax deductions reduce on one hand, mortgage penetration of the adopting country would reduce.\r\n\r\nBy<strong> Tayo Odunsi<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Tayo Odunsi is a chartered surveyor and real estate economist.

I cannot remember a time that we were without water or the rubbish was not collected on time, or the soak-away evacuated as and when due.\r\n\r\nBut the Landlord has done something that I can never forgive him for. In fact when my tenancy expires, I will leave his house. You see, I started renting a unit of 3 bedroom townhouse in his complex when rents in our estate in Lekki were very high. The estate had only a few houses and demand outstripped supply so I was compelled to ‘beg’ him to accept the N3.5m annual rent. He said he wanted a corporate tenant and not an individual as a tenant. After a while, I got used to it and since the others in the complex were paying the same thing, it was not so bad.\r\n\r\nOver the last 4 years however, the estate filled up and over time there were more houses than tenants and ‘For Let’ signs started to show up.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe agent that got me my house offered me a newer unit at the same price but I declined, thinking that it will be hurtful to the Landlord. Now, over the past two years, due to the glut, house rents started coming down, to the point that newer houses were collecting between N2.8m to N3m per annum as rent while older houses like the one I currently stay in, would take N2.5m.\r\n\r\n<u>All this while, my landlord has been collecting N3.5m from me but was collecting N2.5m from the newer tenants.<\/u>\r\n\r\nAfter my last renewal, I found out that my neighbour, who had just moved in, paid only N2.5m as rent! I was livid. I went to the landlord and accused him of disloyalty. He kept looking at me as if I was speaking Greek. After a while, he said that I should not worry and that he will accept N2.5m as next year’s rent. I refused. If he does not return N1m to me now or adjust my next year’s rent of N2.5m by N1m (so I will only pay N1.5m) I will not stay in the house.\r\n\r\nHe responded that he could not do that as we had agreed at the current rent and another term means a new negotiation. He tried to paint me as being unreasonable and going back on a signed and sealed transaction. It was a business transaction and I had the opportunity to reject the terms before committing myself. That, once I had agreed and paid, it was wrong of me to come back to him, to renegotiate the contract!\r\n\r\nCan you imagine? I am supposed to be unreasonable! <u>A man collecting N3.5m from his loyal sitting tenant, while accepting N2.5m from new tenants?<\/u> I am resolved to leave his house at the end of my term.

This week, we look at one of the roles the private sector can play to make housing affordable.<\/em>\r\n\r\n<strong> <\/strong>The term affordable housing is defined and described in various ways depending on who’s doing the narration and where. But UN-Habitat broadly defines affordable housing as “that which is reasonably adequate in standard and location for a lower- and middle-income occupant(s) and does not cost so much that it prohibits the occupant(s) meeting other basic living costs or threaten their enjoyment of basic human rights.” This definition is widely accepted and quoted; partly because the definition resonates with the average listener as a fair depiction of the concept.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLooking carefully at this description, a few inferences can be drawn. Firstly, affordable housing doesn’t infer strictly sub-standard houses in remote locations. That a house is affordable does not mean it has to be the worst house available on the market. Secondly, affordable housing is very cost-centric, seeking out homes for less than average market value. It is this that actually defines a house as being affordable – price. The price has to be right enough to ensure the occupant can meet other basic living costs and enjoy basic human rights life has to offer.\r\n\r\nIn any business or economic transaction what the receiving party essentially seeks is value for money. You enter a grocery store and exchange a Dollar bill for a Snickers bar; you expect to receive a packaged snack with milk chocolate, crunchy nuts and caramel all flowing in one, anything short of this is a reap off. Value for money can either be by attaining a higher quality level at the same price or receiving the same quality level for less money. Either way, subscribers want an efficient and effective product. A widget that meets objectives using fewer resources, and one that meets objectives sooner.\r\n\r\nThe value for money concept partly describes affordable housing. There is no set price limit that makes a house affordable or not, what is important is that it provides <em>higher <\/em>value for money. This can either be by attaining a higher quality level at lower price or offering the same quality level for much less money than ordinarily available on the market. Simply put – affordable houses give much more value for money than commercially available houses.\r\n\r\nSay an average 3-bed apartment of about 120sqm floor plate in your choice location ordinarily sells for circa $100,000. How would you describe a well-built 3-bed apartment in your choice location that is being offered for $60,000? I guess you would describe it as affordable. Or perhaps a steal! This is because the property offers higher value for money.\r\n\r\nThis goes to show the relativity of affordable housing as a concept. It’s a moving target that varies from location to location and transaction to transaction. Affordable housing developers need to tweak their financing, construction techniques, spatial utilization, labour size amongst others to ensure they can offer a property “which is reasonably adequate in standard and location” for lower price. This is achieved by applying technology, ingenuity and where available government and community support to offer higher value for money.\r\n\r\nBy<strong> Tayo Odunsi<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Tayo Odunsi is a chartered surveyor and real estate economist.

Neuroesthetics is a branch of neuroscience that studies the sensual basis for the appreciation of artistic endeavours such as music, art or any other creation by aesthetic perception such as architecture. The existence of this field of study confirms the reality of this “universal language”. Indeed, the architecture of beautiful buildings can make us cheerful and happy, but ugly ones also have the potency to make us sad and melancholy.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn a bid to achieve affordability, design and aesthetics should never be ignored. Houses ought to be a place where children and parents gladly retire to, daily after work, play or learning. It is therefore paramount that the home breeds joy and peace. Irrespective of personal architectural preferences; whether classic or contemporary, ancient or modern, a beautiful building is clear to all just as an ugly one repels.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most people, home designers inclusive, think a beautiful building must be expensive. Clearly, with an open budget a lot of Architects may be able to take a stab at creating a masterpiece, but beauty can also be achieved economically.\r\n\r\n<em> <\/em>Walmer Link is a gated privately developed residential community that comprises 29 apartment blocks amounting to a total of 347 accommodation units in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Walmer Link is simply a beauty. But it is also affordable. More accurately, it is in part social rental housing and partly affordable housing available for outright purchase. The social housing development portion was funded by government subsidies available for social rental housing developments while the affordable housing portion was financed by the Finance Linked Individual Subsidy Programme (FLISP). Consequently, the sale prices of houses at Walmer Link are lower than comparable properties available in the townships. Yet this affordable development is a celebrated beauty winning a regional award for architecture in the Eastern Cape.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Bayview Hills Gardens in San Francisco is both an affordable housing project and stunningly attractive. The project comprises 73 green homes specifically targeted at youths formerly in foster care and families who were homeless. The project won the affordable residential real estate deal of the year 2014 in San Francisco. The building was previously a derelict motel and criminal hideout. Bayview Hills is very artsy and green, funded through collaborations with civic-minded community members and organizations.\r\n\r\nLilac Groove in Leeds is described as the UK’s first affordable ecological cohousing project. Lilac is an acronym for Low Impact Living Affordable Community, founded by a Leeds University geography lecturer – Dr. Paul Chatterton and a few others, with a mission to create eco-friendly and affordable homes. The homes were built using a new low-carbon construction technology called ModCell. The method uses straw and timber to create super-insulated wall panels. The project suffered a prolonged delay in execution primarily due to funding which was provided by the co-housing members. At the end, a multi-award winning minimalist and green housing development that houses twenty happy households was the pleasant result.\r\n\r\nWalmer Link, Bayview Hills and Lilac Groove, along with a myriad of other architecturally pleasing affordable housing projects, which dot the landscapes of cities and towns all across the world go to prove that affordable housing can be both affordable and beautiful.\r\n\r\nBy<strong> Tayo Odunsi<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Tayo Odunsi is a chartered surveyor and real estate economist.

That was until I got home one day and found all my possessions outside the two bedroom flat that I had called home for the past three and a half years. I was so shocked at seeing my things that I could not speak for a few minutes. When I found my voice, I charged at the two men in front of the gate who were looking at me with some derision.\r\n\r\n“What was the meaning of this” I demanded.

The man whom two others and I had called our landlord for over three years was a tenant himself. Worse still, he had not paid rent to the real landlord for over seven years and it was only after a five year court battle that the real owner of the property had gotten his house back.\r\n\r\nWhat a <em>mugu   <\/em>I have been.

I got to meet this righteous sounding tenant when he came to look at a property next to the one I was renting. He looked so desolate that he could not get the property that I took pity on him and suggested that he could share part of mine. He assumed that I was the landlord but he should have suspected something was amiss especially when I agreed to accept a figure 50% lower than the going rate in the area. Of course I got the additional 50% back by scaring him one day that officials from Physical Planning Department had come and were threatening to demolish the alterations we had made to the house. The idiot thought he had found an <em>ode <\/em>Lagos Landlord and so proposed for two others to join him and he collected agency commission and legal fees from them. I was always patient and ensured that I used one style or the other to get my correct money from him.\r\n\r\nAs a ‘tenant’, he was very bad. Never wanting to contribute, always late in his ‘rent’, rejecting reasonable increases in rent and so on. When I knew that the real landlord was soon going to take possession by the courts, I agreed to accept a very low rent from him on the condition that he paid two years rent in advance. The greedy man happily agreed. Then I suggested a deal I was working on, which any three year old baby would know amounted to 419 but Mr Greedy happily accepted to finance it.

The Government’s position is premised on the fact that in almost all of the corruption cases, the proceeds of the crime are used to purchase real estate. If estate agents and other professionals like lawyers  are duty bound to confirm sources of funds for such transactions and report those with suspicious antecedents, this will open another front in the war against corruption. Britain is seen as an obvious choice because of the efficacy of the process against Ex Governor’s Diepreye Alamieyeseigha and James Ibori as well as Ex Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Allison- Madueke.\r\n\r\nHow will it work?\r\n\r\nThe main UK legislation covering anti-money laundering are:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Proceeds of Crime Act 2002<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Money Laundering Regulations 2007<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>The Proceeds of Crime Act<\/strong> sets out the primary offences related to money laundering:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>concealing, disguising, converting, transferring or removing criminal property from the UK<\/li>\r\n \t<li>entering into or becoming involved in an arrangement which facilitates the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by or on behalf of another person<\/li>\r\n \t<li>the acquisition, use and\/or possession of criminal property The main money laundering offences apply to everyone, and you commit an offence if you know or suspect that the property is criminal property.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>It is also an offence to fail to report suspicious activity and tipping off any person that you’ve made such a report.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe Act identifies businesses which are regulated by it to include; Estate Agents and Solicitors involved in financial or real property transactions concerning the buying and selling of real property or business entities. This obligation extends across the whole business, so an Estate Agency Business which also does lettings must also submit suspicious activity reports for its lettings.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Money Laundering Regulations<\/strong> set out what regulated businesses (which include Estate Agents and Solicitors), must do to prevent their services being used for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes when acting in the course of business carried on in the UK. The regulations aim to limit the use of professional services for money laundering by requiring professionals to know their clients and monitor the use of their services by clients.\r\n\r\nSolicitors and Estate Agents under these legislation must be able to identify and assess risks which a customer or transaction may pose and ensure that they put in place appropriate procedures and controls to reduce these risks. Accordingly, they must:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>do customer due diligence for all customers<\/li>\r\n \t<li>have systems to identify those who can’t produce standard documents<\/li>\r\n \t<li>apply enhanced due diligence to take account of the greater potential for money laundering in higher risk cases, specifically when the customer isn’t physically present when being identified, and in respect of politically exposed persons<\/li>\r\n \t<li>not deal with certain persons or entities if you can’t do due diligence, or the results aren’t satisfactory<\/li>\r\n \t<li>have a system for keeping customer information up to date<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWith obvious differences between the practice of real estate transactions in Nigeria and the UK, there will have to be some substantial alterations to the UK regulations to fit Nigeria’s circumstances.

Or the gentle soft spoken lady, show her true colours, contesting every line of the Service Charge invoice? Most important of all, will the tenant be able to pay the rent when it becomes due?\r\n\r\nIn the recent past, the yardstick for determining the ability of the tenant to meet future rent payments was the company he or she works for. Workers in banks, telecommunication companies, oil companies and multi-nationals were are the top of the totem pole. Self-employed entrepreneurs were viewed with some suspicion and employees in SMEs with even more suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe tide seems to have turned somewhat as estate agents are finding that a bank worker can be sacked! Jide, an estate agent managing a block of luxury flats in Ikeja GRA, was shocked that the senior bank official, who was renting one of the apartments, could not pay his rent when he was laid off. The problem was that the official was owing his employers so much that his pay off benefits could not off set his employee loans. From being a good tenant, the man turned into one who started avoiding the agent, defaulting on his rent and service charge.\r\n\r\nSam, another agent managing multiple apartments in Oniru Estate was delighted when an oil services company rented a complex of 6 townhouses. The company paid two years rent in advance and all looked well. When time came for renewal, the company officials explained that they would not be renewing the property as the company was downsizing.  Completely taken by surprise, Sam is now struggling to get tenants for the complex.\r\n\r\nThe task of assessing potential tenants on their capacity to pay has taken a new dimension in the tough financial climes. Erstwhile stable business enterprises facing myriad financial challenges cannot guarantee their profitability and so their employees are also a rent risk.\r\n\r\nIt is not only the economic landscape that is changing – the social dynamics have changed as well. It has become standard for Estate Agents to reject single ladies preferring them to families who are thought to be more stable. Well, in recent times, Nigeria has seen single but extremely comfortable women who are more than capable of meeting their commitments. Chuka, an estate agent, relates his experience of a hardworking but single female entrepreneur who took on a four bedroom duplex in Maryland. She wanted the detached property because she has two dogs. She always pays her rent on time unlike the previous tenants, a couple with two children. Although both were earning good salaries, they did not pay their rent on time. Chuka later found out that it was because they were burdened with paying expensive school fees. When the elder child was moved abroad for schooling, the finances of the family fell apart and the Landlord had to go to court to get them out. Many families, Chuka reasoned, are burdened by social status and have to meet many payments, especially on their children. Singles don’t have that problem.\r\n\r\nBecause of the rapidly changing economic situation and the new social mobility of groups like women, Agents now have to change how they assess tenants that can meet their financial obligations. But there is another major problem – in some segments of the market, the supply glut means that there are more houses then potential tenants. In those markets, estate agents have no choice:  they just have to select tenants based on hope and prayers!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Looking Into The Future: Will The Tenant Be Able To Pay His Rent?","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"looking-into-the-future-will-the-tenant-be-able-to-pay-his-rent","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-07-14 09:25:39","post_modified_gmt":"2018-07-14 09:25:39","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5880","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

In the case of luxury high-end properties, it is a massive struggle. Why? There are many properties competing for their attention and these people tend to be very busy. Any slight wasting of time, they move on to the next property.\r\n\r\nTake the case of  Tunde, a young estate agent sent by his firm to show a busy banker, a townhouse in Ikoyi. He got to the property about 5 minutes late to find the banker, a female, fuming. To make things worse he was not sure of which unit was available and resorted to trying the keys on every unit. By his third attempt, the lady got into her car and drove off. She did not say a word. Efforts to reach her by telephone and email were blocked. After several unanswered calls, she abruptly told the firm that she had paid for another property.\r\n\r\nEstate agents have to change their mentality in dealing with prospects – it has turned into a ‘buyers’ market and firms have to develop processes to ensure that every aspect of communicating the value of the property to clients is executed brilliantly. Of all these, the physical inspection process, which requires direct human intervention, is the one that is prone to errors. There are three elements to getting a seamless inspection process: communication between the prospect and the agent and the staging of the inspection and post inspection.\r\n\r\n<strong>Communication –<\/strong> the Estate Agency must make sure that its staffers are adequately briefed about the property: price, location, size etc. So if the prospect speaks to more than one member of staff at different times, he gets the same information. Inspection times and dates must be specifically agreed to and the Agency must be proactive by confirming dates\/times. There should be a clear line of communication to the prospect in the event of time changes or any new information.\r\n\r\n<strong>Staging the inspection<\/strong> – it seems basic but the agent conducting the inspection must be fully briefed on the property. This gives the prospect confidence that the agent is actually in charge of the property and that the information he is getting is genuine. The inspection process must be thought through. For instance, the prospect should be told the best route to get to the property so that he\/she does not get to the venue flustered. Other details -how to gain access (who holds the keys), the state of the property (an expatriate who saw cockroaches during her visit turned down the property) and showing the property in its best light can give the edge. The best way to do this is to have a ‘dry’ run.  The person showing the property must look the part and be sensitive to the unspoken words of the prospect.\r\n\r\n<strong>Post inspection – <\/strong>closing the deal. The inspection may lead to another inspection (for instance the spouse of the prospect may want to view the property). Otherwise, a follow up phone call, sms or email, clarifying any points raised during the inspection and further highlighting the property’s value should follow up within 24 hours of the viewing. The prospect’s response to this will determine how the Agency pursues the transaction.","post_title":"Passing The Home Inspection Test","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"passing-the-home-inspection-test","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-07-14 09:28:48","post_modified_gmt":"2018-07-14 09:28:48","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5884","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Gov Ambode signs LAGOS STATE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR REFORM BILL 2017\r\n\r\n<strong>Published February 2018<\/strong>\r\n\r\nLagos State may become the first State in Nigeria to have electric power on a 24\/7 basis. This was the promise given by Governor Akinwunmi Ambode as he signed the Electric Power Sector Reform Bill into law last week.  The Law will take care of impediments to investors and operators to committing to the power sector in the state. First, companies generating power will be able to enjoy a guarantee of payment, second, distribution companies will get support on the transmission infrastructure, third, the gas market in the state will be opened up and finally, a raft of offences have been created to ensure that acts inimical to power generation  can be easily prosecuted.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr Olawale Oluwo, Lagos State’s Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources : “One, the law puts the government in a position to be able to extend our guarantee to private sector participants who will come and generate power for us and by this guarantee, we are putting the balance sheet of our State on the table and assuring investors that as they generate power, they will get paid. “Second, is to help the distribution companies to upgrade their infrastructure because if they generate the power and their infrastructure is still where it is today, clearly they will not have the capacity to carry the incremental power. The third area of intervention is that it empowers us to be able to open up the gas market in Lagos so that we can have gas on a consistent basis and that is how we can attain the 24-hour power supply.”\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner explained that Distribution companies will also be assisted in the state to collect tariffs in a cost efficient way with criminal sanctions for those who engage in ‘power theft’.\r\n\r\n“What has happened today is that the first power theft law in Nigeria has been signed today by Governor Ambode and this is the first time any government in Nigeria will institutionalise the power theft law. “It criminalizes power infraction. What we have seen before is that people tamper with and bypass meters and at the end of the day they are arrested and nothing happens but the new law provides for jail terms as well as fines and all sorts of forbearance such that if you tamper with electrical installations, if you import fake electrical materials into this State, you are liable to be prosecuted,”\r\n\r\nLagos State Land Use Charge Law\r\n\r\nAmendment Bill 2018 ….what changes?\r\n\r\nThe  Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, has signed into law, the Land Use Charge Law 2018 passed on 28 January 2018, by the Lagos State House of Assembly, to repeal and replace the Land Use Charge Law 2001. What are the new changes?\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Change in formula to calculate the charges based on ‘market’ or commercial value of land and improvements.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Change in categories of properties exempted. Private cemeteries are now to pay the Land Use Charge. Private libraries will still be exempt but only if they are certified to be non-profit making by the Commissioner of Finance for Lagos State. Only properties owned by religious bodies and used as a places of worship or for religious education are to be exempted. If such properties are leased out to private bodies for revenue generation, then the Land Use Charge will be levied on those properties.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Change in Persons liable to pay the charge. Now, occupiers holding long<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nleases of 10 years and above are liable to pay the charge. Occupiers in unlawful occupation of property are also liable to pay the Charge.\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n \t<li>Appeal against Assessment. The number of tribunals have been reduced from 15 to 9 with the Tribunal having the power to allow for mediation of the assessment. There are conditions under which this is to be done.

I couldn’t think of what the matter was but I immediately rushed to see him the next morning. He was pleased that I was so prompt in responding. After insisting that I took some breakfast, he got to the point. He was angry with me because I was getting married and I did not tell him.\r\n\r\nI was stunned. My long-standing boyfriend had asked me to marry him only a few days ago and very few people had heard about it. How did my Landlord know? I then realised that the other tenants must have told him. When my boyfriend dropped me at home that fateful night, I was shouting, singing and dancing with so much gusto, that my co-tenants had inquired what the matter was. I had no choice but to tell them and they must have told the landlord.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI apologised to him and the following week, introduced him to my fiancé. The Landlord was so charming and supportive that my beau decided that it was better for us to move into my flat instead of his own. This was an argument that we had been having and I was so grateful to the Landlord for subtly swinging the decision my way. I definitely did not want to live in my fiancé’s flat because I knew that he had affairs with other girls there. It would not be suitable for a matrimonial home.\r\n\r\nOver the next four years, my husband and I and our little son, enjoyed the fatherly attentions of the landlord. He came to the wedding and even the naming ceremony of our child. When we had some financial problems and there were delays in paying our rent or service charge, the landlord overruled the agent and warned him not to disturb his ‘children’\r\n\r\nThis was the relationship, the landlord had with all our co-tenants. We all luxuriated in the security of our paternal landlord. Some who had to move because of expanding families did so reluctantly.\r\n\r\nThen one day came the bombshell: a letter from the landlord that he had sold the property! We all could not believe it. We had no idea that he was trying to sell the place. At a hurried meeting of all the tenants, everyone was distressed and angry at the landlord. How could he have done such a thing without telling us? Were we not his ‘children’ anymore? Why did he not give us a chance to buy the property? Did he think we were so poor that we could not afford to buy it?\r\n\r\nAfter a lot of complaining and anguished statements, I was designated as the spokesman to pass on our views to the landlord.\r\n\r\nWhen I met up with him, he was his usual affable self.  As I poured out our feelings, his face changed. He was so surprised. A friend had offered him a fantastic sum and he needed the bulk money urgently to take advantage of an opportunity abroad. It had never crossed his mind to tell us that he was selling the property.  As long as the new owners had promised that they would continue taking care of the tenants, he felt okay with the transaction.\r\n\r\n“Should a landlord have to tell his tenants when he is selling his house?” I kept pondering at his question.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Should a Landlord tell his tenants that he wants to sell his house?","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"should-a-landlord-tell-his-tenants-that-he-wants-to-sell-his-house","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 02:14:53","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 02:14:53","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5882","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Formulating the development strategy is a long process and includes site selection and feasibility analysis, the creation of the project pro forma, and an in-depth analysis of the project appraisal and several processes of obtaining of obtaining a construction loan\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><strong> Important Definitions about Development Strategy<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nThese definitions set the framework for the respective roles of various players in the development process:\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>a )  Developer<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAn individual, firm, or entity that locates and secures control of a parcel of land, conceives and appropriate project to be built on that land and obtains the needed regulatory approval for that project. The developer typically provides the seed capital necessary to get a project to the point where all the development rights are vested. This amount is often several percentage points of forecasted value of a project; that is a hundred million project can easily require several hundred thousands of naira to be fully permitted and quite possibly substantial additional funds. These funds are usually reimbursed at the start of the construction or at the close of the construction loan by the investor providing the equity for the project. The developer also usually receives a “promote” or return for the time he has invested and risk he has taken in putting together or promoting the project.\r\n\r\n<strong>b )  Builder<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe general contractor who does the actual construction of a project, generally by bidding the job out to a variety of subcontractors. The builder must “ bond ” a project , that is , provide assurances from a third party insurer, guarantor, or surety that the builder will provide the funds to finish the project for the contracted price if the builder does not perform as agreed. The contract may be cost plus a fee or fixed price\r\n\r\n<strong>c )   Investor ( owner)<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAn individual, firm or other entity that provides the equity capital necessary to build a project. Frequently investors do not commit themselves until the project is fully vested with development rights. The investor must often assume personal or corporate liability for the construction loan.\r\n\r\n<strong>d )  Lender<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAn individual, firm or other entity that provides the debt capital necessary to build the project. The lender will not commit until the project is fully vested with development rights.\r\n\r\n<strong>e )  Property Manager<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTypically, an individual, firm or other entity who handles property\/facility management once the project is completed and who also may handle the marketing and management of the lease-up and stabilization phase of the project.\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n \t<li><strong> The Concept: Product Identification and Establishment of Criteria<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nMost developers tend to specialize within a particular sector of development e.g office complex, strip malls, industrial warehouse, residential communities, high rise. Even within a particular sector, there is a tendency to further sub specialization. The selection of a development concept, product identification, and establishment of development criteria are often a matter of strategic pre-selection based on the developers prior tract record and the company ’ s chosen focus. Although some expansion is normal and even expected – that is, into an adjacent state or subsector— a developer choosing to stray too far from his field of expertise will find it more difficult to attract debt and equity capital.\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n \t<li><strong> Seed Capital and Assembling the Team<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nMost developers have existing sources of seed capital, internal or external, that can be tapped for projects. Almost as a matter of definition, a developer without access to some sort of capital is not a developer. Most experienced developers also have a well-vetted team, both internally and externally, with whom they have worked over the years. In that case, assembling the team may be as simple as gathering the veterans of prior developments together and reviewing the development criteria, alerting them to block out time on their work schedule as appropriate, and receiving feedback as to changing market or regulatory conditions.\r\n\r\nIf a developer is venturing into a new market or sector he may choose to assemble a new team with experience in that area. There are many ways to find out who the respected professional are in any given area.\r\n\r\nAppraisers, real estate brokers, title companies and real estate lawyers are good sources of information.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5894\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Babafemi-Awofala-MD-Brickstone-Partners-Limited-300x275.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"275\" \/>\r\n\r\nBabafemi Awofala is the Founder and Managing Director of Brickstone Partners Limited,\r\n\r\nan integrated professional service firm providing project finance advisory and transaction\r\n\r\nstructuring for the energy, infrastructure and real estate industry in West Africa. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brickstone-partners.com\">www.brickstone-partners.com<\/a> Mobile 08051262691 Email: <a href=\"mailto:hello@brickstone-partners.com\">hello@brickstone-partners.com<\/a>\r\n\r\nContinued next week\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n \t<li><strong> Market Area Identification<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nAn interesting question is raised as to which is better: a fantastic site ( great visibility, choice demographics, excellent drive-by traffic ) in a so-so market ( mediocre occupancy, slightly below average rent etc) or a so-so site ( nearby power lines, bad sight lines, questionable surrounding area ) in a fantastic market ( robust rent growth, booming economy, tight and raising occupancy) .\r\n\r\nUnless there is a reason to believe that the so-so market conditions are permanent rather than just a phase in a normal business or real estate cycle), choosing the best site over the best market is the prevailing choice, in theory, because markets recover but site cannot move. Although the theory is a simplification, in that the factors that make a site great can change (traffic patterns evolve and demographics are not set in stone), site characteristics do tend to be more stable than market conditions.\r\n\r\nEvery developer produces a product or service designed to meet a particular need. To improve one ’ s chances, it is wise to select a market that is not already saturated by competition, a market that needs a product that can be produced at a competitive price with a good quality and workmanship, a market that shows signs of future growth and improvement. A good indication of current market needs can be found by determining the present vacancy rate, current construction activity, and forecast of growth in demand\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n \t<li><strong> Land Acquisition: Optioning the Land, Securing Control<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nAfter initial investigations indicate that there is a reasonable probability of success for the proposed project on a given site, several important steps must be taken. The land on which to construct the project must be secured, regulatory approvals must be obtained, and capital commitments for both the equity and debt portions of the financing must be received.\r\n\r\nIt’s advisable for developers to gain control of the land via an option to purchase the land.\r\n\r\nAn option to purchase is the right, for a limited period of time, to purchase the land at an agreed upon price and terms. This option minimizes the loss of capital if for any reason construction does not go forward. More than one project has been stymied because of last-minute regulatory issue, interest rate hike, construction cost jump, or other market change.\r\n\r\nOptions may be structured in as many ways as a creative developer or his lawyer can devise, but frequently there is an up-front monetary payment and additional monthly payments. These may or may not be applied to the purchased land. Often a landowner will give a reputable developer a free, 45-to-90-day “ look see ”; that is, the developer puts soft capital ( refundable) to show good, marketable title with no undisclosed defects or quiet partners who might surface are the last moment with additional complications\r\n\r\nConversations should be conducted with the appropriate planning officials to discuss the viability of the proposed projects from a regulatory point of view. The option should include full rights to go onto the property, conduct studies ( environmental audits, etc ), do tests ( soil borings, etc ) and generally do further due diligence relating to permits necessary for developments.\r\n\r\nIn hot markets or for a top grade site, a land owner may adopt a take-it-or leave it approach and insist on immediate purchase. In that case, the initiative and advantage lies with the developer who has access to ready capital and whose local market knowledge makes him plunge prior to full vesting of all development rights.\r\n\r\nSometimes a landowner is willing to contribute her land in return for an interest in the development or provide a long term lease. Such a lease would have to convey full development rights, automatically be subordinate to any financing, and typically be for a minimum term of 30 years; 99 –years are not uncommon.\r\n<ol start=\"6\">\r\n \t<li><strong> Site Approvals and Building Permit<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nOnce the proper land use designation and zoning are clarified, the next step is usually to develop a site plan that shows where the buildings and parking will be located on the site. It generally shows how the developer intends to hook into the necessary utilities ( water, sewer, electricity); comply with various regulations such as building height, lot coverage ratios, floor-area ratio and landscaping and demonstrate compliance with local transportation plans and water management.\r\n\r\nThe length of time necessary to obtain a building permit is a critical factor in development. It may take weeks or months between the initial submission of completed plans and the receipt of approval to commence construction.\r\n\r\nOften a site-clearing permit or even a foundation permit can be obtained in advance of the full permit, allowing substantial progress to be made and helping a fast track project stay on time.\r\n<ol start=\"7\">\r\n \t<li><strong> Construction Financing and Implementation<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nA developer will find it essential to develop a general familiarity with the financial markets that have the capability to fund such projects. In addition, a developer must develop access to key people within those markets (such as bank officers and mortgage brokers). One or more sources of funding for the project should be located early on, either by sending out preliminary project packages. Potential lenders may respond with a term sheet, non-bidding, highly-qualified letter stating the amount and the terms under which they would lend on the project as presented.\r\n\r\nAn investor provides the equity capital necessary for actual construction to aid the debt capital to be secured. The developer usually provides the seed equity necessary to get the project to construction. Investors can be individuals of high net worth, insurance companies, and investment banks. Developers may have established a working relationship with an investor or group of investors. A track record of successes tends to attract a following, and a successful developer may accumulate the funds to make a significant investment in his own projects.\r\n\r\nA developer may choose the desired builder early in the process and have that builder work closely with the architect in designing the project, providing ongoing feedback on best construction methods and material.

With the abundance of cheap and good quality laterite deposits in various parts of the country on the one hand and the prevalent rising cost of construction materials on the other, the use of lateritic pavers for estate road construction in place of concrete interlocks and asphaltic (tarred) roads may just be the real deal.\r\n\r\nIn structural\/highway engineering terms, the Red Road is designed as a light and medium-traffic road with individual unit of paver having the same compressive strength as that of Grade M40 concrete (i.e. 40N\/sqMM) as obtainable in concrete pavers for the construction of similar road types. Light and medium traffic roads includes car parks, office driveways, housing estate roads, rural roads, farm houses, office\/commercial complexes, boulevards, city streets, small market roads, intersections\/rotaries, utility cuts on arteries, service stations, etc. If properly constructed, the red road sufficiently satisfies nearly all known functional requirements for roads with durability potential believed to span beyond 50 years during which only little maintenance is needed.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBecause one of the main constituent material, Laterite which usually amounts for more than 50% by volume of the mix in the red pavers normally contains up to 70% clay -which is known to be ‘plastic’ in nature, the thin gaps or voids between interlocking pavers allows for expansion and contraction across various seasons and at different temperatures; although a suitable infill material which does not affect this natural process can also be used to seal the void. Some engineers also lay damp proof membrane (dpm) beneath the bed in areas with high water table.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs applicable with concrete pavers, pavers for red roads are built on good bedding usually made of highly-draining sand spread uniformly to form a longitudinal bearing throughout the surface area of the road up to a thickness of 100mm or more depending on the subsoil conditions. Stoppers are installed at the edges of the road with protected linkages to the adjourning drainage to prevent the bedding sand from washing off. In areas where highly compressive soils like clay and peat are encountered at near surface levels, the poor soil is first excavated and a more stable earth fill is used to replace it before the bedding is made. The bedding in any case must be properly leveled and compacted before the lateritic pavers are laid to avoid depressions, bulges and over-settlements at various sections as they receive varying degree of stresses from live loads.\r\n\r\nRed roads are built from lateritic pavers made of a stable mix of laterite, crushed stone\/stone dust and cement. The proportion of each constituent material known as the mix ratio largely depends on the expected bearing capacity of the road. For instance, the percentage by weight of stone dust in the mix is often higher for pavers to be used in main arterial roads (i.e. the road(s) leading from the main estate entrance gate to the streets) than the pavers used on the streets (or branch roads) because the load bearing requirements are relatively different.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"> <\/span>\r\n\r\nRecently (March 2017), a kilometer of dual carriage red-road to be constructed by an indigenous firm in Garki, Abuja has already been estimated to cost some 37% less compared to the use of conventional methods. Interestingly also, for lovers of road ‘black’, the red road can also be sprayed black with hot black soot material at an extra fractional cost and still maintain its functionality. As it stands now, Red-roads may soon become a part of our road life.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5900\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Engr.-Osaz-Enobakhare-284x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"284\" height=\"300\" \/>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"96\"><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<td width=\"513\">\r\n<table width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Engr.

At N300, 000 per annum, he knew from <em>Castles Lifestyle<\/em> that the rent in that location was easily over a million Naira. The deal made him throw caution to the wind: he did not even tell his Pastor to pray about it, which was his custom when making serious decisions. Even the altercation between the agent and one of the occupants during the inspection did not faze him. The man had asked the agent why “leading the sheep to the slaughter.”\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHis major concern was the economics of getting the studio flat. First, the was incredibly cheap even cheaper than the one he was renting in Egbeda. Another plus was the high calibre tenants he would be mingling with. He was sure that the connections would stand him in good stead in the future. The icing on the cake was the savings he would make in transport fare to his office in Victoria Island. He moved his wedding plans by several months just thinking about the situation.\r\n\r\nHowever, the first night he spent in his dream apartment was not a good dream. He had a horrible nightmare. He woke up that morning drenched in sweat but could not remember what the dream was all about. His only recollection was a woman’s voice, repeatedly saying “why nah? Why nah? Why nah?” He put it out of his mind and decided that that he will make conscious effort to meet his top class neighbours as they set out for work. His greeting however evoked funny stares which he put down to snobbish behaviour.\r\n\r\n“Why nah? Why nah? why nah?” the haunting voice was his constant companion all night. He decided that he would invite his Pastor to pray with him in the place. The next morning, he was accosted by a neighbour who narrated the story that scared him. Apparently a young girl who had lived in that flat was murdered 3 years ago. The neighbours found the heart of the young lady hacked into pieces in flat. It was suspected that her boyfriend was responsible for the murder but was never proven. Before Bayo packed into the flat about 3 men that rented the place had to quit. Each with the same complaint of the sound at night. Another tenant who heard the tail end of the conversation laughed it off. He said that there was a tree beside the apartment which gave that kind of sound when the wind blew through its leaves. Bayo was not even listening to what the man said – he had just realised that he was in a discussion with two General Managers of new generation banks! By now both men had realised it was getting late and left with a promise to call Bayo that night when they returned. Bayo was in seventh heaven as he left to his office. He was already making top connections! But what about this ghost business? He called his Pastor to pray there with him that night. If the Man of God did not pick up any signals, all was well and the explanation of the second tenant was probably correct. That night, the pastor came, prayed and anointed the flat. The pastor prophesied that he would ‘prosper’ in this place. Bayo shook off the suspicion that his Pastor was more interested in the connections he too could make from the other neighbours rather than spiritual warfare. That night, the sound (blood speaking?) came again. Was this a warning or was there a scientific explanation for this? Should Bayo pack out, lose his rent and give up all the advantages of Ikoyi life?

Was owning a ten year lease on a block of flats in South West Ikoyi any basis to propose marriage to the richest heiress in Nigeria after meeting her just three hours ago? Kunle was about to find out!\r\n\r\nOlufunmilayo Olusola blinked. “What kind of negotiation tactics is that?” Her eyes had the merry look of a woman who knows that the man in front of her had fallen hard for her. “Femi said that you were ijebu and would try to bargain hard on my fees but I didn't think you will go so far to bargain. This interior decorator business is hard o!”\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI took up the joke, letting out a sigh of relief that she was not making fun of me “ I promise to keep you in the manner to which you have become accustomed as long as you cut 50% off your fees”. The jokes and banter continued but there was an interesting tension between us, as if we stopped joking we would have to deal with the question I had impulsively raised. Over the next three months, we saw each other virtually everyday, using the redecorating of my flat as an excuse.\r\n\r\nAfter mine, we moved to the other flats in the block as the intention was to let the flats out to pay off the decoration costs. Despite all her wealth Olufunmilayo Olusola was as good a penny pincher as I was, perhaps even better (or worse depending on how you look at it), ready to negotiate in Orile or Alaba markets. This was a girl after my heart. We found that we were a good team, one compensating for the other.\r\n\r\nI ran out of money after the third flat and while waiting for my overdraft application from my bank to clear Olufunmilayo Olusola started using her money to buy vital things. Our accounts were started to get intermingled. I tried to protest but when I saw the hurt look in her eyes, I backed down. It made sense for me to join her as a signatory to my account when the overdraft came through. As a 'joke' she added my name to her account. We were more intertwined than the average husband and wife. She knew all about me and I knew all about her.\r\n\r\nThere was a problem. The renovation of the flat was coming to an end. There would be no reason to see each other everyday and speak on the phone late into the night. We had become so close that her Father in a (Freudian?) slip had referred to me as his son-in-law and her mother and the rest of the family continued with whatever quarrels or intimate family conversations they were having even if I was in the room. In the meantime, I had let two of the flats to expatriates and the remaining three to top Nigerian bankers. They agreed to move in, in two months time, when the renovation would be complete. With their money in my hands it was time to settle Olufunmilayo Olusola.\r\n\r\nI took her to our favourite café in Ikoyi. We had a secluded corner where we could see all the comings and goings but we couldn't be easily seen. When we had settled down, I went down on one knee in a joking manner, intending to hand over the cheque. I was barely on one knee when Olufunmilayo Olusola said “yes, yes, I will marry you!” I gave her the biggest kiss this side of the equator. “Where's my ring?” she asked after we had exchanged protestations of undying love and why did we take so long etc. I had to tell her. 'it's only a cheque I had”\r\n\r\n“Ijebu” she called me and the jokes began again.\r\n\r\nThere was really no need to have a prolonged engagement. Her father said that if we could have renovated a property together without any major quarrel, then marriage was 'a small thing'. As we all sat together, planning the wedding, I became more and more aghast at the cost, the budget went up until it reached N30million. Olufunmilayo Olusola was even more annoyed.\r\n\r\n“I refuse to be part of this jamboree' she put her foot down. While her father was sympathetic, her mother simply went on her planning spree. Olufunmilayo Olusola resorted to sabotaging the arrangements- she did not show up for her flight to Paris for wedding dress fittings, mixed up the bride and groom's colours on the invitation cards and somehow got the Reverend to move the wedding to a smaller chapel instead of the main church. Something had to give. Her father was the first to make peace. His offer: “I will give you the cost of the wedding towards any investment you want if you let your mother have her way with the wedding”\r\n\r\nOlufunmilayo Olusola negotiated an additional 50% to the peace offering for all the stress and aggravation her Mother had caused her. That is how we got N45m cash into our account. She also insisted that all presents should be in cash and with all the spraying in front of Sunny Ade we got an additional N10m. We had great fun planning our investments. We would put 30% in the stockmarket and the rest in land in Lekki which we would build with the next rents we got on the South West Ikoyi block of flats. Life was good.\r\n\r\nThe expatriates moved in first. Being technical guys, they had a pick up truck each. We had no issues with them. Then the bankers moved in. I got back home from work to meet my wife arguing with Emeka a Deputy General Manager in one of the new generation banks. He had landed with a Range Rover for Sunday use, a 'C' class Mercedes Benz for his wife and a Toyota Prado SUV which was his official car. Unfortunately, each flat had only two parking slots and he had parked one of the cars in our slot. My wife, Olufunmilayo Olusola had pointed out that he was encroaching on our space and apparently Emeka had made disparaging remarks about our battered Honda Civic. Sam, one of the expatriates came to the rescue by giving up one of his slots.\r\n\r\nToye, top shot Executive Director moved in the next day. He had four cars the difference being that he had the obligatory Range Rover well as a Mercedes Benz 'E' Class as official cars, a Toyota Prado for runs and an Audi TT for boys night out. His wife and three children were still in Abuja, his last posting and it was agreed that they remain there so as not to disrupt the children's schooling. A man with four cars. Again they tried Olufunmilayo Olusola by parking the balance two cars in our parking space. While Toye was urbane and pleasant, his drivers (he had two) were not. Despite our warnings they kept parking in our space and eventually Tom the other expatriate moved his boat which was parked in his slot and Toye's parked one car in Tom's slot and the other in the slot of the third banker who had not moved in.\r\n\r\nWhat is it with bankers and Land Rovers? Ejike moved in with a Land Rover, topped with a Porsche Cayenne and a Toyota Camry as his official car. ‘I have a soft spot for 'jeeps' he said. ‘I am just 'managing' the Camry’ he added, infuriating Olufunmilayo Olusola.\r\n\r\nThere were now thirteen cars in the compound which could only park twelve.  ‘Ten’ Olufunmilayo Olusola, corrected me. She was not going to give up any of her spaces even though we had only one car. The tenants had a meeting and we got a letter signed by them all. They suggested that since the expatriate pick ups were open at the back, it would not be safe to park them outside the compound so that left my battered Honda Civic. Would we mind giving up our space and parking our car outside. Olufunmilayo Olusola blew her top……..\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo be continued next week.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Car wars (1)","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"car-wars-1","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 02:14:26","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 02:14:26","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5904","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

He then proceeded to answer, turning logic on its head. The tenants meant no disrespect but as our Honda Civic was not as expensive as the other cars, it was the right choice to be parked outside. Besides, the tenants could pay for any damage if it was vandalized.

I had heard that her father was very ruthless (you did not get to be one of the richest men in the country by being a Boy Scout) but I did not realize that his daughter might have inherited that streak from him.\r\n\r\nShe turned and left Emeka standing on the doorstep of our unit of the townhouse complex.

The newspapers had photos of the car and the ‘couple’. I let out a gasp. Looking disheveled and drunk, was Toye! Events moved quickly. He was suspended from his job and his wife moved back to Lagos with his children. All entreaties for her to stay in Abuja were rebuffed. He had to find a family home. He came to meet me asking for permission to sub-let. Olufunmilayo Olusolahad told me that it would be over her ‘dead body’ if I accepted. Toye cut a sorry figure. He unburdened himself to me. True, he had gone to a club but he had taken only a glass of wine. His friends, who he was with, said that he disappeared after going to the toilet. Someone had seen a group of men moving a heavy load from the club but that witness had suddenly disappeared and the prostitute was also no where to be found. He had been framed.

Some require property as a ‘base’ they use during their frequent trips, others as a future retirement home while some want an investment in their home country. With the Naira nudging an exchange rate of N370 to the United States Dollar, Nigerians in diaspora are taking a closer look at the property market. This has resulted in several developers making presentations to our compatriots in diaspora to attract them to their developments. Some developers have been successful but the majority have not. This is primarily because the developers have continued to use communication directed at the home market for the ‘foreign’ market, with little or no modification.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor developers to tap into this potential customer base, they must have a clear idea of what these potential customers will be looking for as well as how to structure the transaction. From questionnaires sent to thirty Nigerians living in the United Kingdom, the ideal property would be priced around GBP50,000 to GBP60,000 (N23.5m to N28.2m). The majority intend to finance this by releasing equity from their property in the UK but will be open to getting mortgages from Nigerian banks….if the interest rates are reasonable. If mortgages or extended payment plans are available the average respondent stated that they would be able to go up to GBP80,000 (N37.6m). All the respondents said that they were not interested in living in the property but would like to get rental investment from it. So for them, the after sale services of finding a tenant and maintaining\/running the property is critical. Because of negative perceptions of sharp practices, all say that the reputation of the developers is the most critical aspect of the transaction. “We must be able to see a glowing track record and the property developer must be ready to give serious commitments to allay my misgivings about the Nigerian property scene” was what one of the investors put in their comment box. Location wise 70 percent choose the Lekki axis but with the driving force being investment, all respondents were open to investing in any area of Lagos, if “their investment” is safe.\r\n\r\nOne interesting point that came out of the survey was the ambivalence concerning land purchases. 70% said that they would not buy land because they were worried about encroachment and also how they would be able to develop the land. There are many sorry cases about relatives who collect money but do not use it to develop the land. Again, the trust factor is at play here – if there is a structured way to build the houses, then the naysayers say that they will be interested in buying land.  Generally, those interested in buying land and building, view the property purchase from the angle of retirement homes. Therefore, developers who are interested in such prospects must come up with products for these set of Nigerians.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5910\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/flag-300x187.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" \/>\r\n\r\nNigerians in diaspora are looking for well-priced mortgage deals denominated in Naira\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Higher Exchange Rate Is Good News For Diaspora Property Investors","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"higher-exchange-rate-is-good-news-for-diaspora-property-investors","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 02:07:59","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 02:07:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5902","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

After pondering these questions we decided to take a scientific approach to this problem.  We would observe these successful developers and come up with a hypothesis as to why they are so successful.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nThe first thing we observed was that these successful developers had a very good track record for developing durable and functional projects, but most importantly they delivered their projects on time. Due to the experience factor they have mastered how long it would take them to conclude a project. So when an investor is coming in on the ground level, or even before ground is broken, he or she has a good idea when the project would be completed. This is very interesting because it gives a potential homebuyer or investor a timeline in which they can spread out their payment and make arrangements to come up with the money. With property prices on the island well above the Hundred Million-Naira range, this makes excellent economic sense. Let’s take an example here: Mr Thomas wants to buy a 4 bedroom serviced flat in Ikoyi. At today’s prices, a lot of what is on offer is about N160m and these flats are already completed, Mr Thomas cannot opt for any extra amenities that the developer has not made available without breaking walls and spending extra money.\r\n\r\nMr Thomas runs into a developer about to break ground on a block of 10 units of 4 bed flats and offers him the option of putting down 25% now and securing a flat which will be ready in 24 months. After Mr Thomas does his research and sees other such projects that have been done by the developer, he is convinced. He gets to break down his payments and has the potential of his property having a higher value at the time of delivery. In addition the sales agreement gives Mr Thomas the opportunity to pay for this property over an extended period of time, the ability to have a say in the materials used to finish his unit and also an exit clause in the event that he cannot finish making all the payments as agreed.\r\n\r\nThe second thing we observed about these successful developers is that they are excellent at profiling their customers. It is not enough to just develop a block of flats in Ikoyi and believe that an Oil company will take it because of the location and a swimming pool, or that some successful executive will buy it as a status symbol. We find that a lot of developers underestimate the sophistication of the typical buyer of a  N160million property.  Take the case of two clients currently looking for much the same thing, but for different reasons. The first clients are a young married couple, they are both very well educated, well-travelled and need a serviced apartment with 3 bedrooms for their growing family and a BQ for a nanny. They are young professionals and spend a great deal of time at work, so when they come home they want to relax. They don’t want to deal with paying a security guard, water treatment issues and handling diesel procurement and storage. So for them any random flat wouldn’t do, it has to be well finished, with amenities and a space they can relax and entertain in.\r\n\r\nThe second client is quite the opposite. They can be termed ‘empty nesters’.  They are a couple in their late 50’s, they have been married for 30 years have built and stayed all over Lagos, now they live in a sprawling 6 bedroom house in Lekki 1. The husband is a Chairman of a medium sized company and the wife is a successful business woman. They have 5 adult children; all but one of them lives at home. When they started making plans for their current home they envisioned that their kids would be around or their grandkids would come over to play in the garden, but as it stands now, they find themselves alone in this big house most nights.\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough both clients have taken interest in a new development that is about to start in Ikoyi,  a 4 Bed terrace house that will be delivered in 24 months. The older couple wants to merge 2 rooms into one to form a bigger master suite, use another room as a home office and a guest room for the grandkids. The younger couple wants to keep all 4 bedrooms, want a dedicated playroom for the children with cctv so they can keep an eye on them.  The developers of this project are okay with incorporating different features to meet the needs of their clients, and at the ground level these additions or subtractions can be made easily.\r\n\r\nFollowing the last observation, leads us to the next, which is that successful developers who sell off plan do a very good job of anticipating the needs of their customers. These developers make standard amenities to help their customers live and enjoy the spaces they create; they are mindful to not over develop and leave space for ample parking and recreational activities. They anticipate the needs of their customers by providing pre-wired cable outlets for their units or providing an intercom service so the occupants can reach the gate house and servants quarters conveniently from their units There are many supposed “high end” properties with quoted prices in excess of N150m, but no provisions were made for DSTV! Basically the buyer would have to start trunking cables all over the house. Or a property that has an asking price of N250m that doesn’t come with cctv so the inhabitants of the house can see their surroundings, after all home invasions and armed robberies do happen. Or multi-room audio systems, which are standard in houses commanding such prices.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is that success in property development and sales is not random, there are deliberate actions taken to reach these expected ends. These developers protect their brands and always deliver on time thereby creating an environment where people can trust their word, a premium in this part of the world. They target their customers very carefully and provide world class amenities in anticipation of their needs. This is why on the same street one development is sold out and another hasn’t even sold a single unit.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"How To Sell Off Plan……..","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"how-to-sell-off-plan-when-others-cannot-sell-completed-buildings","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 13:45:11","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 13:45:11","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5914","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The influx of potential homeowners into less developed and upcoming areas have continued to create investment opportunities for budding small and medium scale property developers. On the mainland, areas like Ikorodu, Lagos-Ogun axis which encompasses <strong>Isheri North, Arepo, Magboro, Ibafo, Mowe-Ofada, Shimawa and Agbara-Igbesa<\/strong> currently have a high rate of property development activities because of the availability of affordable expanse of developable plots of land; same for areas like <strong>Sangotedo, Abijo, Lakowe<\/strong> and the entire <strong>Ibeju-Lekki axis<\/strong> on the Island. In middle end of the market, areas like <strong>Magodo Isheri, Mende Maryland, Ogba, Yaba, Ebute Metta<\/strong> and <strong>Surulere<\/strong> on the Mainland has the highest number of ongoing developments targeted at middle level income earners; the same for areas like <strong>Ikate Elegushi, Agungi, Ikota<\/strong>, and <strong>Ajah<\/strong> on the Island. Understanding the market also requires knowing the traditional land owning practices in these areas, price of plots, available title documents and physical planning regulations as well as the major building materials markets and suppliers in the area. It is also important to know what people are buying in these areas and at what price.\r\n\r\n<strong>Where to Build<\/strong>\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt is vital to know that each of the different markets have their own unique features and characteristics. For example, land prices and topography of areas may vary and go a long way in determining what it will cost to build a property there. Despite the relatively low financial status of your target clients, you must ensure that the area you decided to situate your development must be very accessible and have basic public utilities. You may also decide to start building in an area you are somewhat familiar with. For example, if you have lived all your life on the Mainland, it may just be reasonable to start from there before trying the Island.\r\n\r\n<strong>What to Build<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAt this level of the market, what is clearly in high demand are small unit apartment blocks that comes in flats, townhouses and terraces. It is important to note that each of these types of developments have their own peculiar advantages and challenges. Whichever type of properties you decide to build, do not try to overdo anything especially in terms of aesthetics and finishings. You must understand that no matter what you do, the price matters a lot to this class of buyers. It is recommended that unit prices should be not exceed N20m for the budget end of the market and N45m for the middle level income earners.\r\n\r\n<strong>Getting Finance<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSome of the easiest ways of raising funds at this point includes going into a Joint Venture with a landowner or another developer, pooling together funds from friends, business associates or relations. The other option is getting a loan from a bank. However, for a start, it is always advisable and safer to stay with the first two options.\r\n\r\n<strong>Selling the Property<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe best option at this stage is to attempt to get buyers for the property before it completed (off plan sales). Strategies like Installment Payment Plan for buyers have been very effective. Getting relevant information across to potential buyers of your developments would also require you spending some money on advertisement. Regular advert placement in a medium like Castles Lifestyle Magazine have been very helpful to a lot of small\/ medium scale developers. To also facilitate sales, you may have to partner with Primary Mortgage Institutions to help in providing long term financing for buyers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Practical Guides To Getting Started As A Lagos Property Developer","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"practical-guides-to-getting-started-as-a-small-medium-scale-lagos-property-developer-entry-level-skills-for-developers","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 13:44:47","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 13:44:47","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5917","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The interpretation of this vague use of words can be the difference between jail time or fine for a Landlord oR his agent. This is the precise wording of Section 44 of the Tenancy Law of Lagos State (see box) and is the Government’s attempt to deal with ‘self-help’ landlords who do not use the courts to eject their tenants.\r\n\r\nThe law rightly criminalises this type of behaviour but by adding threatening actions or words to the mix, it could give tenants an undue advantage in negotiations and dealings with either the landlord or his agent. The section has tried to limit the ‘threats’ and ‘molestations’ to such actions or words that are linked to ejecting a tenant. But it is possible that a tenant can link any action or words of his landlord or agent to potential ejection.\r\n\r\nOur research shows that this section has been rarely used and there seems to be no record of anyone charged or convicted under this section. This is possibly due to section not being well known.

There is a temptation for those building houses to make it the best they can…….not minding the expense.  Is this wise?\r\n\r\n<strong>Published August 2017<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAfter acrimonious meetings with the kitchen designer, a wife announced to her husband that she had ‘managed’ to bring the price down to N10million. It was to be a showpiece kitchen with all the latest appliances and gadgets and a table top made of very rare granite. Her husband felt it was too expensive for their budget but succumbed to the reasoning that they should do their house ‘right’ once and for all. They both continued along this line struggling to get the best possible in terms of materials and workmanship and the result was a showpiece of a house.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nThe next issue they faced was that their old furniture looked out of place in their new house.  With a large ante room, three living rooms, a dining area, TV room, five bedrooms fully ensuite and a study, the cost of furnishing came to the princely sum of N5m. There was still the cost of new air-conditioners, electronics and a generator to factor in.  At this stage, the couple were tired and prone to fighting as the bills came in. Their everyday bills were still coming in – children’s school fees, living expenses and to top it all since they could not move into their new house, they had to pay one  more year’s rent in the present apartment.\r\n\r\nThey eventually moved in and everyone was thrilled by the movie set like house. But the wife had one advice for all those who came to her hoping to get the same look in their houses: “Don’t be like me” She hardly used the expensive kitchen as her family still stuck to their old type of food – they were not interested in the <em>oyibo <\/em>gourmet dishes the kitchen could produce. Even the kitchen was a shadow of its former self as one housemaid had used the wrong cleaning agent and defaced the cabinets and cooktop! Their expensive furniture had to be kept at a certain temperature so the generator had to be turned up and the air-conditioners run for about three hours every day (even when they travelled and the house was locked up) otherwise the wood would warp. And they barely used the television room or any of the formal living areas. The family congregated in the family lounge every night and even guests joined them there. it was their eldest child who pointed out that despite their new expansive lodgings, they were only using the same space they did when they were living in the three bedroom flat!\r\n\r\nThere is a temptation to get a showpiece home when you have the opportunity to build your own house. It is perfectly understandable but keep these rules in mind when going for broke as you may end up broke!\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Have a budget and stick to it. If you have cost overruns in one section, compensate by reducing cost in another area. For example, if you must have that new Jacuzzi in your bathroom, you could save the costs by replacing a bath in the guestroom with a shower.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Your budget should include costs of moving in: generator, new furniture, air-conditioners etc<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Review the number and sizes of rooms in the design. Do you really need a toilet attached to the study?! Will you use that TV room?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Have maintenance at the back of your mind: how will you clean the ‘must have’ chandelier installed in the cathedral ceiling?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Finally, what is the opportunity cost of spending so much money on the house?

It focused on engaging and enlightening younger female investors and their families with practical knowledge on investing in residential property.\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to feature below an account from one of the female guests, Joy Ehonwa a lagos based writer and blogger.\r\n\r\nI’m not wealthy yet, not by a long shot. Editors don’t earn much, and writers are paid even less, so when a client I have great respect for invited me to a real estate investment seminar last week, I wondered why.\r\n\r\n<em>Perhaps she has seen into my future and I’m about to come into money!<\/em> After all, investing in real estate is for rich, financially free people, isn’t it?\r\n\r\nI gladly went, eager to learn something I could use in the not-so-near future.\r\n\r\nIt turns out I was wrong. Real estate isn’t just for the rich and established! Real estate is for me, a young woman in her 30s trying to build a career and raise a family. Real estate is for you, too. And we can start now.\r\n\r\nThe event, which held on Friday May 26th, was an introductory seminar, simply encouraging women to be bold enough to “consider a field” as the Proverbs 31 woman did, even if you’re not ready to buy the field just yet.\r\n\r\nAs I listened to seasoned professionals – Abigail Aneke, former United Bank for Africa (UBA) ED, Subu Giwa-Amu, MD\/CEO FBN Mortgage, and the host Udo Okonjo, CEO of Fine &amp; Country – share their real estate investment stories, my mentality underwent a major overhaul. MAJOR.\r\n\r\nI cannot possibly share every single thing I learnt at this edition of Fine &amp; Country International’s Finer Wealth Series – it would take 5 articles to do that – but here are just a few priceless nuggets:\r\n\r\n<strong>1. The Starting Point For Anyone Who Wants To Invest In Real Estate Is Considering It And You Don’t Need Money In Your Pocket To Do That.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nBeing bold enough to consider it is the foundation.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. It Is Possible To Invest In Real Estate Without Money<\/strong>.\r\n\r\nUdo Okonjo told the story of how a book titled <em>Nothing Down<\/em> taught her this and changed her outlook, leading her to earn $100,000 on a single investment 18 years ago, without her putting any money down.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. If You Would Like To Finance Your First Investment, You Can Start Saving For It Right Away.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis meant the most to me as a young person who has never invested in real estate before. Treasury bills were recommended (look this up if you’re not already familiar with it) amongst other low risk investments that can help you multiply your money. I already knew that saving towards a goal makes it easier and more enjoyable, but whereas I thought real estate investment too lofty a goal for me, I no longer think so.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Instead Of Thinking Affordability, Think Collaboration.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to invest in real estate alone, or even save up for the investment all by yourself. People come together to acquire property all the time! Even if you don’t have any money now, check out this scenario: you and 9 other women save 100k every month. In a year, your group would be able to afford property worth 12 million that none of you can afford individually. And you already know that even if all you do is buy land and sit on it for a few years, it will appreciate and you’ll all be richer for it when you offload and share profits!  This is what Finer Wealth Circles are about.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. The First Step To Making Money In Real Estate Is Research.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nKnow your location and ask lots and lots of questions.\r\n\r\n6. <strong>An Unsuccessful First Venture Need Not Mean Failure.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nUdo Okonjo, who is an incredibly successful real estate investor, shared the story of her first investment which was a disaster. According to her, such a thing can only be termed failure when you don’t get up, unpack it, and learn from it. Understand that you will make mistakes, even when you become astute. Learn to forgive yourself.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. When Buying Real Estate, Control Is Key.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis was the main lesson Udo Okonjo learnt from that first disaster. Invest around where you are, and make sure due de-risking has been done. If you don’t know how, invest through schemes that have done the groundwork of securing the title and dealing with the <em>baales <\/em>and other such issues that can derail you.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. When Investing In Property, The Title Is Everything.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis is why Fine &amp; Country settles this first, before proceeding to anything else.\r\n\r\n<strong>9. When Starting Out In Real Estate, Start Simple.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFor instance, it’s always a good idea to house people. People are crying out for affordable accommodation.\r\n\r\n<strong>10. Know That Real Estate Is A Long-Term Play.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s not liquid, and it takes time to extract liquidity from it, so don’t come at it with a “make it quick” attitude.\r\n\r\n<strong>11. Even If You Can’t Do Anything Else For Starters, Buy Some Land.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nLand is a great option because you can’t go wrong once you’ve secured it. Unlike developed property which you need to maintain, land increases in value on its own as time passes. You can even decide to lease it to a farmer, or rent it to a telecommunications company. Udo Okonjo quoted Mark Twain: “Buy land, they’re not making it anymore.”\r\n\r\nI came away from the seminar feeling wealthier than I ever have, even though my account balance was exactly the same.\r\n\r\nI may not be able to buy land right now, but I’m no longer ignoring real estate broadcast messages and ads.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities are endless if you simply open your mind to the fact that you, too, can invest in real estate. Once that can happen in your mind, it can happen in your life.\r\n\r\nI missed the 2016 edition of the Finer Wealth Series last year (Ibukun Awosika Chairman of First Bank Plc shared her real estate investment stories, please cry with me) but I certainly don’t want to miss next year’s. Neither should you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"REAL ESTATE SECRETS EVERY YOUNG NIGERIAN SHOULD KNOW","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"real-estate-secrets-every-young-nigerian-should-know","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-07-14 11:41:07","post_modified_gmt":"2018-07-14 11:41:07","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5945","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

We are only just emerging from recession and hopefully have learnt the hard lessons necessary to build a more robust, sustainable and broad based economy. We are finally beginning to see renewed international investor interest. Jim Rogers, a well-known international investor recently pointed to Nigeria as one his emerging\/frontier market picks offering the potential for strong growth on the back of policy improvements.

However financing challenges exist due to the long term nature of the investment and institutional preference for risk free treasury bills.\r\n\r\n<strong>INTRODUCTION<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNEWSFLASH&gt; MCO Real Estate has re-branded as MCORE to better align itself towards the provision of certain services that may be perceived to fall outside a core real estate remit. Such services include our reach into alternative assets such as oil and gas and transport infrastructure.

The price of crude stood at US$58 p\/b by the end of the third quarter, the increased price and production increases allowing for an accrual of foreign reserves which stood at US$32.5Bn by the end of the third quarter an increase of a third on October 2016 lows of US$24Bn. An increase in the availability of dollars has also assisted the real economy and the manufacturing sector in particular. The Nigerian exchange rate has now been stable at $1\/N305 for the past year moderating inflationary pressures which have fallen on a consistent month by month basis from a January high of 18.72 per cent to the current September figure of 15.98 per cent, albeit with considerable work to be done to bring inflation back to a long term single digit target. The economy is still very weak and policy initiatives that lead to a broader base for growth beyond oil are essential to make the economy more resilient to future shocks.\r\n\r\n<strong>REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT<\/strong>\r\n\r\nLocal real estate and construction lending rates are hitting new highs of up to 36 per cent2. These high lending rates speak to the bank’s unwillingness to lend to the real sector based on their perception of risk compared to the high yields available from risk free treasury bills. They are also a reflection of the high percentage of non-performing loans within the banking system that have left the bank’s with considerable quantities of property that were used as collateral to secure a lot of the historical borrowing that took place prior to the recession. The banks are now seeking to off-load these distressed assets and are finding out that a considerable number of the asset current values have fallen well below the values of the outstanding loan amounts.\r\n\r\nFor international investors whose returns are often benchmarked in dollars, the over-riding view is that of a long term trend in the fall of the Naira against the Dollar. Even where the investment is showing a strong Naira return, factoring in the long term depreciation of the local currency may turn an attractive Naira return into a less attractive dollar return. However, international investors are still driven to seek higher returns and are still drawn to the potential high returns in the Nigerian markets. Investors are currently staying away from long term investments where there is greater exposure to the potential of a depreciating Naira and are more attracted to investments that can be turned around within a shorter time frame with the potential of an exit within three years via a sale or other exit.\r\n\r\n<strong>PRIME LAND<\/strong>\r\n\r\nCurrent Lagos Island prime land average sales prices in receding order are as follows; Eko Atlantic N524,000 \/\r\n\r\n$1,700 psqm, Banana Island N385,000 \/ $1,261 psqm, Victoria Island N380,000 \/ $1,250 psqm, Ikoyi N369,000 \/\r\n\r\n$1,210 psqm, Lekki Phase 1 N195,000 \/ $640 psqm, Oniru N168,000 \/ $550 psqm.\r\n\r\nPrices have remained stable over the last year showing a growth rate of only 1 per cent in both Naira and USD terms. Oniru has shown the strongest growth of 10 per cent while Victoria Island at the other end of the scale has fallen by 5 per cent over the last year. Eko Atlantic remains the most expensive of the locations we track with a 37 per cent premium above neighbouring Victoria Island. The premium reflects the improved standards of infrastructure in the Eko Atlantic City but is also reflective of Eko Atlantic land prices benchmarked in dollars. The gap between Victoria Island, Ikoyi and Banana Island prices has narrowed considerably with these areas falling within a price range of only 4 per cent in relation to each other. Oniru and Lekki Phase 1 prices continue to track each other, both becoming increasingly commercialised as smaller professional businesses convert residential units to office use as an alternative to higher rents prevalent in nearby Victoria Island.\r\n\r\n<strong>COMMERCIAL OFFICE<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the new supply of Class A commercial office space to the Ikoyi and Victoria Island office markets over the last few years combined with a fall away in demand over the same period due to the recession has fermented competition between new higher quality Class A space and older historical Class A space. The new space has pushed the old Class A space down the rankings to re-emerge as Class B space with an attendant negative impact on achievable rents.\r\n\r\nThe new prime Ikoyi\/Victoria Island space commands rents as high as $750 psqm, however, rents for Class B space formerly classed as A space have fallen from a high of up to $900psqm a couple of years ago to as low of $450 psqm in order to remain competitive. At these reduced prices, Class B rents are now becoming affordable to a wider array of businesses that used to occupy residential accommodation re-purposed as office space, allowing such businesses to migrate into purpose built office space at rents higher than but still comparable to former residential re-purposed office space.\r\n\r\nHistorical commercial office locations in Lagos include Marina, Victoria Island, Ikoyi and Ikeja. In recent times, Lekki Phase 1 with an attractive location abutting Victoria Island is now vying to join this group with the introduction of purpose built Class B office space currently being built primarily along the Admiralty Way. Floor areas are generally smaller and number of floors less than in neighbouring Victoria Island, however the smaller leasable areas allow for an easier absorption of the space into the still emerging Lekki Phase 1 market. Occupiers are primarily professional service firms, traditionally occupying residential property in the Lekki Phase 1 \/ Oniru area who see the benefit of purpose built office space without having to pay Victoria Island rents. Rents range from as low as N50,000 \/ $140 psqm to a high of up to N180,000 \/ $500 psqm.\r\n\r\n<strong>STUDENT HOUSING<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe emerging student accommodation opportunity is driven by a widening gap between a growing student population and little or no student accommodation supply. The ability to sign a long lease on land belonging to a higher institution or acquiring land adjoining a higher institution, building and charging a ready pool of student offtakers a market rent with 100 per cent occupancies leading to a stable cashflow sounds like a real estate developer’s dream. Universities are latching onto the trend, offering land parcels to developers under a long term Build Operate and Transfer model and seeking a share of revenues in exchange. Gross yields can be as high as 15 per cent however, a closer look and the story is not as easy as it sounds.\r\n\r\nTo be attractive, the sector has to be sustainable. With treasury bills offering risk free rates of up to 18 per cent, allocating funds to risky greenfield development in exchange for a 15 per cent yield does not sound so attractive.\r\n\r\nInternational investors to whom a 15 per cent yield may sound very attractive also have to contend with the currency risk inherent in a potentially depreciating Naira eating up dollar returns especially over a long timeframe. A market that appears to offer stellar returns may hold dangers lurking beneath. However, attractive returns may exist for the investor that is able to create a well branded, scalable, institutional offering that can roll out a high volume quality product at low cost.\r\n\r\nWith special thanks to Student Accommod8, Nigeria’s first and only student accommodation brand.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nABOUT US\r\n\r\nMCORE is a real estate investment and advisory firm that offers services and solutions to a global audience of investors, developers and other third parties towards the development of and investment in large scale real estate and infrastructure projects.

This did not turn out to be the case as many real estate firms admitted to CASTLES Lifestyle that they did not record a single sale transaction in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to these firms mid-year, the tone has changed. Instead of a resignation that things would get worse, there is optimism that ‘deals were being closed’ and buyers are more receptive to sale offers.\r\n\r\nSo what happened?\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe first thing is that there is generally more confidence in the economy. Latest figures show that inflation is down and the foreign exchange reserves are up. With the intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in the forex market, the Naira has gained ground against foreign currencies especially in the parallel market. The Stockmarket Index has also gone up. The general expectation, as stated by respected bodies like the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation is that Nigeria will come out of recession this year. So the perception is that Nigeria has seen the worst of its economic situation and that the only way is up.\r\n\r\nThis means that some property investors who found that holding their money in foreign exchange instead of property are returning to the market. <u>An estate agent recounted the story of an investor who wanted to hold his money in United States Dollars for a few months to get some exchange gains, burnt his fingers when the dollars he bought at N500\/$1 could only be exchanged for N400\/$1 a few weeks later! <\/u>He has returned fully to the property market.\r\n\r\nApart from the general better economic news, there have been many structural changes in the property market. It has now become accepted industry creed that it is a buyers market and this has influenced rental rates and prices. An Ikoyi property owner who held out for N900m on his property has come down to N750m and is prepared to accept a payment plan with payments spread over 8 months. On the other hand, buyers also are accepting that sellers will not conduct fire sales and so after months of negotiating and losing on some properties, they are now ready to conclude on transactions. Also Joint Venture (JV) deals are increasingly taking off as this is considered ‘win-win’ for both the seller and buyer. Many large acreages which could not be sold in the usual manner were disposed of through a JV.\r\n\r\nHowever, the market situation means that transactions are taking longer to conclude. A typical transaction can take up to three months compared to two weeks a few years ago. Real Estate Practitioners also have to be able to structure payment plans that suit both parties and this is having implications for their commissions\/fees. CASTLES Lifestyle had advised few editions back that Real Estate Agencies should work on expanding their property management portfolios as this would be a steady and surer source of income. This is coming home to roost.\r\n\r\nAs real estate practitioners continue to find a middle ground between sellers and buyers, it is expected that the second half of 2017 will witness a flurry of deals and transactions in the real estate market.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Confidence returns to property market","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"confidence-returns-to-property-market-as-number-of-sales-transactions-improves","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 13:50:43","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 13:50:43","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5949","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

This was usually applied to cases where the landlord was insisting on a particular rent, which the agent could not get, with the effect that the property was unoccupied despite offers for it at a lower price. The Landlord would defend the unoccupied status of the property with the maxim of the house not requiring to be fed. He was not losing anything by the property remaining vacant.<\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Economists would disagree with such statements, arguing that there is an opportunity cost to leaving the property vacant. The concept of opportunity cost is usually lost on property investors who are prone to prefer to wait for the tenant who would pay the rent they want, regardless of how long it will take to get such tenant. If the landlord does not understand that concept, he will at least grasp the fact that even if there is no tenant in the property, he is still liable to meet the service charge, if the property is liable to service charge. If property does not ‘eat’ before, any landlord who buys property which is subject to service charge, knows that there will be outflows if the property is vacant. This is because the tenant bears the service charge ordinarily.<\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Awareness of this caveat to the maxim that properties do not ‘eat’ has started influencing behaviour of landlords and their advisers. A top estate agent told CASTLES Lifestyle that a tenant of his, who owned a flat in 1004, had stormed out of a negotiation meeting with the tenant who was to renew his tenancy. The Landlord did not like the fact that the tenant was not budging his position on the renewed rent and the landlord also did not like his ‘attitude’. By the time the estate agent advised on how much he would have to meet as service charge during the void period the tenant left and a new one was found, the Landlord climbed off his high horse and the negotiations were concluded on a ‘win win’ basis. The landlord in question did not understand the finer points of opportunity costs but when he realised that money would be coming out of his pocket during a void period, he changed his tune quickly.<\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Another instance where a house does ‘eat’ is if you purchased property with a mortgage. Any ‘buy to let’ Landlord who bought the property with a mortgage knows that interest charges come every month. If he is expecting rent to pay all or part of these charges, he must understand that the rent cash flow must be continuously flowing. Again, this type of Landlord cannot fall into the mistaken idea that the house is not ‘eating’. If bought with a mortgage, it is feasting on interest and other charges!!<\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><em> <\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"When houses start ‘eating’!","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"when-houses-start-eating","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 02:06:14","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 02:06:14","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5951","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

They use the funds of many investors to purchase and manage real estate property and\/or mortgages to provide a way for individual, small and large investors to invest in large scale properties and earn a share of the income produced through real estate ownership – without actually having to go out and buy the real estate.\r\n\r\nThe current size of Nigerian REIT sector stood at c. ₦40bn ($131m at the official rate) in May 2017 through three REITs that account for less than 0.5% of the entire stock exchange. In developed countries with more advanced capital markets, REITs typically account for 2.5% – 5% of the entire stock exchange. Two REIT issuances worth over ₦33bn ($108m) failed to list between 2012 and 2014 and another with a market cap of ₦20bn ($66m) <a href=\"https:\/\/estateintel.com\/initial-public-offer-for-top-services-limiteds-%e2%82%a620bn-reit-approved-by-nse\/\">attempted an issuance<\/a> earlier this year but an <em>official<\/em> response on the <a href=\"https:\/\/m.popkey.co\/f021db\/RwbMl.gif\">outcome<\/a> is yet to be been published.

There are few valuers in the Nigerian market with extensive experience in valuing investment grade commercial assets and there is not sufficient data to standardize valuation outcomes and provide comfort to investors.\r\n\r\n<strong>Shallow Asset Pipeline<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe pool of available investment grade assets that have the ability to generate attractive and sustainable cashflows is shallow. This needs to deepen through the introduction of a larger number of investors that have the depth of appropriate experience to deliver quality assets and preserve and enhance values. Niyi Adeleye of Stanbic IBTC Capital rightly noted that at ₦40bn ($131m), the entire size of the Nigerian REIT sector is of less value than the <a href=\"https:\/\/estateintel.com\/nigerias-ikeja-city-mall-sold-to-hyprop-and-attacq\/\">price Ikeja City Mall traded during its sale in 2015<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Minimal Market Knowledge<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe low level of investor familiarity with the REIT sector makes it hard for the sector to be widely accepted and adopted.\r\n\r\n<strong>High Interest Rate Environment<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe high interest rate environment (which is admittedly temporary) makes it difficult to create a case for asset classes that currently appear to be low yielding. When a risk free rate (1 Year FG Treasury Bill) is close to 23%, asset managers are unlikely to take on any additional risk for similar or less returns.\r\n\r\n<strong>Regulator Action Points<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe <strong>SEC<\/strong> is currently working closely with Stanbic IBTC Capital to review Nigerian <a href=\"https:\/\/estateintel.com\/ei-legal-hub-nigeria-real-estate-laws\/\">REIT Rules<\/a>. Ongoing engagement include discussions around treating REITs as a distinct asset class, broadening of the SEC approval process e.g. registration of consultants\/valuers and providing sufficient clarity on the minimum valuation guidelines. A provision that enables SPVs transfer real estate assets between themselves to avoid fees was also mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe SEC Proposed <a href=\"https:\/\/estateintel.com\/ei-legal-hub-nigeria-real-estate-laws\/\">Amendments to REITs<\/a> published in early 2016 include an increase in permitted leverage levels from 25% of shareholders fund to 40% of Gross Asset Value (GAV). It loosens restrictions on foreign asset ownership by allowing a maximum of 25% GAV be invested in other African countries, an amendment which could have very positive implications because it could encourage Pan-African property investors raise capital or exit their investments in Nigeria. The amendments also provide clarity on rental income distribution guidelines, which must be at least 75% and distributed every 2 years at the minimum.\r\n\r\nThe<strong> Nigerian Stock Exchange<\/strong> is seeking foster transparency in REITs and Closed End Funds listed on The Exchange by introducing a requirement for them to submit key performance metrics (occupancy rates etc) on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nREITs and Closed End Funds listed on the Exchange have also been reclassified from the main board to a separate board specially created for them to improve awareness.\r\n\r\nThe X Issuer Portal, where listed companies typically submit quarterly financials and more, will also become easily available to the public.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe <strong>FIRS<\/strong> is committed to taking the issue of fees &amp; multi-taxation to the joint tax board, whose major function is to advise all tiers of Government on tax matters, and to ensure an efficient tax administration system in the country.\r\n\r\nOngoing engagement with the FIRS includes developing a REIT circular to clarify current tax laws and REIT regulation to modify issues required for effective tax structures.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"NSE pushes the REIT agenda.","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"nse-pushes-the-reit-agenda","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 02:06:13","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 02:06:13","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5954","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Goke (not his real name) who made his money from oil service contacts is a typical example: his 'house'. Is a two floor maisonette type penthouse, the last two floors of a six floor apartment block in Banana Island, Ikoyi. Why didn't he build a. Mansion like any other 'big boy'. Apart from the need to maximise his investment by getting rents from the other flats which he has leased out, he is looking at the future. His teenage children will be leaving the house in a few years for 'A' levels in England and their university abroad and from experience he knows that it is not likely that they will have a 'family' home in Nigeria. \"This place will be more like a hotel that they will stay inn when they come for holidays and short breaks. Why should I have an empty big house used fully only a few weeks in the year?\" he asks rhetorically.[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHis friend, a professional who has a similar apartment in a quiet area of Victoria Island, with views of the Atlantic adds some more reasons: you don't bother with issues like security, diesel etc - you just pay a service charge, which as the owner of the building you can pay when you like! In a single dwelling you have to sort this out and when you grow older it cannot be easy. \"I remember seeing my father in his seventies arguing with the driver who he accused of stealing his diesel while simultaneously have an acerbic conversation with the generator repairer on the phone and intermittently abusing the security man\" that won't happen to me. Finally, when I pass on, the apartment block of 8 flats means each of my 4 children get two flats. There should be no acrimony as I had with my siblings trying to divide an 8 bedroom house in Surulere!\"\r\n\r\nNot everyone can build luxury apartments in Ikoyi and Victoria island but if you are in a position to build your property, you should build with your pensionable years in mind. Even if you must build that mansion, make sure the architectural design is such that it can be reconfigured into smaller lettable units. You can stay in one of these apartments and let out the rest, meaning that you not only get tenants to share in the common services you also get companionship. So instead of a massive house which is too big for an old man or woman, you get a useful asset that can generate income and fit your new lifestyle. And when you are gone, at least the kids get a blessing not some property that is a source of contention.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"How the rich build with retirement in mind.","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"how-the-rich-build-with-retirement-in-mind-how-you-can-emulate-them","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 13:50:41","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 13:50:41","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5957","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Over the\r\n\r\npast 12 to 18 months the macroeconomic challenges that\r\n\r\nfaced the country resulted in reduced demand from US and\r\n\r\nEuropean retailers. As these retailers adopt a wait and see\r\n\r\napproach, retailers from China and Turkey have intensified\r\n\r\ntheir interest in the Nigerian retail sector.\r\n\r\nIncreased interest in some cases have translated into active\r\n\r\nnegotiations as well as concluded leasing transactions. Miniso\r\n\r\nprovides a case in point as one such retailer from the Far\r\n\r\nEast looking to establish a firm presence in the retail market.\r\n\r\nMiniso commenced trading in the third quarter in a number\r\n\r\nof shops across core locations, taking up close to 4,000m2\r\n\r\nof retail space with plans to open additional stores in other\r\n\r\nsecondary markets.\r\n\r\nFrom a local perspective, existing retailers continued to\r\n\r\nremain cautious given their experience in the market. Many\r\n\r\ncontinue to reassess their strategies, halting expansion plans\r\n\r\ninto newer schemes, simultaneously consolidating operations\r\n\r\nin the best performing locations and malls in which they have\r\n\r\na presence.\r\n\r\n<strong> [read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Retail Market – Landlord View Point<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn order to remain competitive, maintain and drive up\r\n\r\noccupancy levels in malls, most landlords across the market\r\n\r\nhave continued to utilise concessions to stay attractive. This\r\n\r\nhas especially been the case in recently opened malls that\r\n\r\nhave increased the supply of retail space across the market.\r\n\r\nConcessions which are typically geared towards reducing\r\n\r\nretailers’ initial capital outlay are adopted differently by\r\n\r\nlandlords and continue to be extended on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nThey range from lower rents and longer rent free periods to\r\n\r\nlower and fixed exchange rates. These tend to offer more\r\n\r\ncertainty around rents which are usually stated in US dollars\r\n\r\nbut payable in naira. Some landlords have also been willing\r\n\r\nto consider different rent structures including payment in\r\n\r\ninstalments and stepped rentals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nVacancy rates have dropped from 58% to 30% and 41% to 38%\r\n\r\nin core and secondary locations respectively. It is important to\r\n\r\nnote that this reduction in vacancy levels has come on the back\r\n\r\nof longer negotiation periods and the willingness of landlords\r\n\r\nto consider and extend concessionary leasing conditions.\r\n\r\nAlready established schemes such as Palms Lekki and Ikeja\r\n\r\nCity Mall continue to benefit from first mover and locational\r\n\r\nadvantages, commanding the highest rents and recording\r\n\r\nnear 100% occupation levels.\r\n\r\nAverage asking rentals for spaces between 100m2 and 200m2\r\n\r\nare currently around US$44\/m2\/month and US$30\/m2\/\r\n\r\nmonth in core and secondary locations respectively.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>OutLook<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe retail sector continued to face some challenges despite\r\n\r\nthe recovery recorded in wider macroeconomic indicators. The\r\n\r\neffects of a fairly stable naira, reduced inflationary pressure\r\n\r\nand the economy’s emergence from recession are yet to have\r\n\r\nsignificant ripple effects on the retail sector.\r\n\r\nWe expect that developers who are keen to commence new\r\n\r\nprojects will adapt their plans given the realities of oversupply,\r\n\r\na shallow tenant pool and slower leasing activity in the\r\n\r\nmarket.

Today, in 2018, the same plot is slightly above N200m. So anyone who paid for the plot in 1999, would have made N198m profit on the transaction. The N198m is what is known in investment terms as capital gains. Capital gain is the difference in the value of the property down compared to when you bought it. Rent as we discussed last week is what the property owner gets from someone who uses the property for a while. Major difference between rent and capital gain in cashflow terms is that you can continue to enjoy revenue (rent) by giving up possession of the property for a period. You don’t give up ownership of the property. But for you to enjoy the cash from the increase in the value of the property, you have to sell.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe point that you have to sell to enjoy the capital gains* is very important when we are considering real estate investment. This is because as a general rule, property tends to appreciate. So even if you buy property as your home or for rental income, the value will go up. As you don’t intend to sell these properties, that is outside of our consideration here. We are looking at a scenario where you buy property with the express intention of reselling it for a higher price at a later date.\r\n\r\nWhat factors do you have to consider when you are buying real estate to sell at a higher price subsequently?\r\n\r\n<strong>Holding Period<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFirst is how long do you want to hold the asset before selling? Accepted wisdom is that the longer you hold, the higher the price. So if you want to hold for a short period, say between a year to two years, then there must be a factor or factors that will make the price move in such a short (for real estate investment) time. One is shortage of supply. If there is only one plot of land left in a desirable estate and you have the money, you can reasonably expect that within two years someone will come to buy the property at a premium. Another factor that can make property desirable is if some deficiency is going to be cured. So plots of land around the route of the new rail line in Lagos which suffered from poor transport links to the city centre, will become more desirable when the line is complete. Or land covered by a ‘mere’ Letter of Allocation, which is considered as an inferior title will be cheap but as soon as the Certificate of Occupancy on the property is processed, the price goes up. So for quick transactions, there is some skill. For long term, say about 5 years, buying in areas that are not well developed and so reasonably cheap, is a good way to invest. As soon as development reaches the area, the price would have gone up and you can sell. Locations like Ibeju Lekki and the Mowe Ofada axis are good for this kind of strategy. Having said that, four years ago, land in Lekki 1 was trading at around N150m per 1,000sqm plot and today, such plot is going for N200m to N220m.\r\n\r\n<strong>Land or developed property<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSecond factor you should consider is whether you should buy land or developed property. Developed property means you can enjoy a hybrid return of rents during the holding period and also enjoy capital gains when the property is sold. This means that you have to invest more money as developed properties generally cost more than bare land. You also have to get into the management of the property during the holding period. It also appears that it is generally, easier to sell land and the returns better than developed property.\r\n\r\n<strong>Transaction Costs<\/strong>\r\n\r\nA third factor to consider is cost of the transaction. Buying and selling land is not cheap. Agency fees can be anything from 5% to 10% of the price of the property. Perfection (Governor’s Consent and Land Registry registration) could add another 10% as fees. When selling the investor is also subject to Capital Gains Tax on the profit he had made on the transaction.\r\n\r\n<strong>Rate of return<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn the good old days up to 2010, property values could double in a year. In 1999, a 675sqm plot of land in Victoria Garden City sold for N1.7m.  Three years later, it was N12m. But those days have gone and property price rises are more conservative now. So it is up to the investor to check if the capital gains he is expected are commensurate to other investments like shares, Treasury Bills etc\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"A Layman’s Guide to Real Estate Investment (2)","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"a-laymans-guide-to-real-estate-investment-2-how-to-get-capital-gains-on-property-in-these-tough-times","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 13:50:34","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 13:50:34","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5964","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Although the economy remained in recession with GDP growth in the first quarter at -0.52%, the economy contracted at a lower rate compared to the previous three quarters.\r\n\r\nThere was also a silver lining with respect to inflationary pressure in the economy. After sustaining an upward trajectory for 27 months, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) peaked at 18.72% in January before declining, reaching 16.25% in May.\r\n\r\nForeign reserves also experienced a significant boost, growing by around 16% throughout the first half of 2017 to just over US$30 billion. This growth, driven by a relative resurgence in the global oil price and uninterrupted local production, provided an opportunity for the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to aggressively defend the naira (₦). Through the sale of over US$4 billion, the CBN was able to improve liquidity across different segments of the foreign exchange market. Whilst a notable difference remains between the official and parallel market rates, this improved forex liquidity has led to a significant convergence between both markets with the naira strengthening by around 30% from a peak of ₦516\/US$ in February to ₦364\/US$ in June on the more accessible parallel market. The improved forex conditions also provided an incentive for the CBN to open a new forex window for investors and exporters thus inciting some confidence in the investment market.\r\n\r\nThrough this window, investors and exporters are able to repatriate investment capital, pay dividends, conduct export related transactions and meet other financial obligations.\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned aspects signify much needed respite for what has been a sustained period of negative economic performance. However, consolidating these relative improvements will require a sustainable regulatory framework that reduces uncertainty in the economy as well as the coordination of monetary and fiscal policies to improve macroeconomic conditions.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n<strong>RETAIL MARKET OVERVIEW <\/strong>\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the respite reflected in some macroeconomic indicators, the harsh reality facing the retail sector remained largely unchanged. The negative macroeconomic performance recorded over the past 12 to18 months continued to have a slowing effect on the sector putting pressure on retailers and landlords alike. Whilst the improvement in forex liquidity and the ease in inflationary pressure were welcome developments, they remain relatively recent occurrences and are yet to sustain improved consumer confidence. This slowing effect on the sector has been reflected by slower take-up rates in recently delivered schemes which have taken much longer to fully let. Additionally, as retailers reassess their expansion plans, there has been more focus on older, more established shopping centres in core markets, causing recently delivered centres in both core markets and second tier cities to record slower leasing activity.\r\n\r\nThe tenants’ market which has materialised has strengthened the negotiating position of many prospective tenants. This has sustained a downward pressure on asking and achievable rents and has spurred the demand for more favourable leasing conditions and commercial terms. In order to remain competitive many landlords have acceded to these demands and have been more willing to extend concessions as a way of attracting tenants to their centres. Additionally, amidst the challenging business environment, many landlords have sought innovative ways of driving performance and increasing the vibrancy in their centres. Consequently, some landlords have undertaken the reorganisation of their tenant-mix by adding kids play areas and other entertainment activities. Retail schemes that did not have provisions for cinemas in their designs are also looking to retrofit cinema screens into their existing structures.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, the retail sector stands to benefit as the positive macroeconomic performance gains traction.\r\n\r\nAs inflation trends downwards and forex liquidity improves, it is expected that spending power amongst consumers will improve whilst retailers see some of their operational costs reduce. The new forex window opened by the CBN for investors is also expected to revive some confidence as landlords are now able to carry out dollar based transactions and meet other financial obligations much easier.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is important to note that this new window might put upward pressure on effective rents. As some landlords look to benchmark their rents with the rates offered on the forex window, rents which are quoted in dollars but paid in naira might trend higher as this window offers a devalued naira rate. Currently, average asking rents for 100m2 - 200m2 of prime retail space are roughly US$62\/m2\/month in the core markets of Abuja and Lagos whereas rentals in secondary markets are around US$44\/ m2\/month. Whilst no new shopping centre developments were delivered in the first half of 2017, around 50,000m2 is expected to be delivered over the next 6 to 12 months.\r\n\r\n<strong>OFFICE MARKET OVERVIEW <\/strong>\r\n\r\nRelocations by corporates from B-grade and standalone buildings to better quality space in A-grade buildings in Victoria Island and Ikoyi remained a key theme in the first half of 2017. These relocations continued to be driven by more favourable leasing terms in the market as a result of the vacancies in recently delivered buildings. In a bid to remain competitive, landlords continued to extend concessions by way of lower rents, longer rent free periods and additional fit-out allowances. Overall, demand from existing corporates as well as new entrants cutting across the finance, technology, entertainment, pharmaceutical and FMCG sectors was noted. Whilst most of these corporates opt for newer, better quality buildings in the core markets of Ikoyi and Victoria Island, there were also some enquiries for office space in secondary locations. This demand emanated predominantly from FMCG companies with specific preference for the mainland in view of cheaper occupational costs, a desire to locate close to warehouses and production sites as well as allowing easier commute for employees. Throughout the first half of the year there was also a resurgence in demand for larger office spaces in the occupier market. Whilst smaller office requirements of 200m2 to 500m2 held sway, enquiries and transactions for spaces exceeding 1,000m2 were noted in the core markets of Ikoyi and Victoria Island. Average asking rents for office space within these core markets vary between approximately US$33\/m2\/month to US$41\/m2\/month for B-grade spaces, while A-grade spaces have average asking rentals of US$54\/m2\/month to US$64\/m2\/month.\r\n\r\nThe increased dollar liquidity in the economy and the opening of the forex window for investors has boded well for landlords. Transactions which hitherto faced constraints and difficulty, such as the repatriation of investment capital and the repayment of dollar based loans and dividends, are now able to be conducted with relative ease given the improved access to forex in this new window. Although confidence is emerging in the investor market, it remains too early to determine the extent to which the improving economic indicators and improved dollar liquidity will drive investment activity in the office sector.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of 2017 no new office deliveries were recorded, however around 52,000m2 of A-grade office space is expected to be delivered to the core markets of Ikoyi and Victoria Island over the next 6 to 12 months.\r\n\r\n<strong>INDUSTRIAL MARKET OVERVIEW <\/strong>\r\n\r\nOther than some recorded relocations, there has been little noteworthy activity in the industrial market throughout the first half of the year.\r\n\r\nThe overarching challenges posed by Nigeria’s largely underdeveloped industrial and manufacturing base, through the decades, continue to have an adverse effect on the industrial sector.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is a significant mismatch between the demand and supply of stock in the market. Most of the existing facilities are old and designed with low eave heights as well as inadequate turning circles which do not meet the quality and standards required by many corporates.\r\n\r\nOver the years, the case for allocating much needed investment capital towards developing new industrial parks has been less convincing from an investors’ viewpoint. As such, the development appetite in the industrial market has been much less aggressive relative to the office, retail and residential sectors. The high cost and limited availability of land in desired locations such as Lagos as well as the lack of adequate infrastructure to transport goods from cheaper sites situated further away from commercial hubs reduces the investment potential of the sector. This is further emphasised by the rents commanded which are currently too low to attract much needed investment capital. Average asking rentals for prime industrial space ranges from US$1\/m2\/month US$5\/m2\/month, depending on location.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that sustained demand for industrial space from both international and local corporates mainly in the FMCG, pharmaceutical and retail sectors continues to be evident. In view of the inadequate supply, many occupiers have been constrained to owner occupation or renting older stock which has to undergo significant upgrades in order to meet desired standards and requirements.\r\n\r\nOver the coming years, increased activity in the industrial sector will hinge on sustainable policies to revive the industrial and manufacturing base of the country. This would be strengthened by investment into adequate attendant infrastructure (roads, rail, ports, power, etc.) that can lead to the repositioning of the sector. Whilst the current government’s plan to diversify the economy and reduce the country’s dependence on imports is a step in the right direction, the full impact on the industrial sector will be better determined over the long-term.\r\n\r\n<strong>About the author<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFounded in 1975, Broll Property Group is an award-winning and one of Africa ́s leading commercial property services companies serving the investor and occupier markets.

These are major high points on their agenda. These became more pressing when the country entered recession. Learning the hard way that over reliance on oil revenue is not sustainable; governments at federal and state levels have heighten the drive in collection of tax revenue at an unprecedented tempo.\r\n\r\nQ: But in Nigeria, there is always apprehension on the subject of taxation as  individuals and organizations tend to believe that taxation is more of extortion than revenue source\r\n\r\nThere is usually an atmosphere of anxiety with respect to the impact of tax drive on businesses including real estate. However, on the assumption that the tax authorities will follow due process and the laws in their drive, one can say there should be no cause for anxiety. In any case, the current position is that businesses are normally required by law to pay tax.  While parting with funds in form of taxes may be burdensome to businesses, the positive side is that when the government deploys such funds for good uses such as providing critical infrastructure for businesses to thrive and security among others, the benefits of such payments can be quite satisfying.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is a positive side to the government’s awakening to its tax enforcement responsibility. A weak enforcement regime where few are compelled to pay taxes and majority is allowed to carry on their businesses without paying taxes creates an unfair competition.\r\n\r\nQ: As a Real Estate Developer, what is your assessment of compliance to payment of tax in Nigeria?\r\n\r\nAs an incorporated real estate development company, there are numerous obligations the tax authorities expect from you. You are required to deduct applicable withholding tax from contractors, consultants and suppliers on your projects and pass them to government.\r\n\r\nWhen contractors, consultants and suppliers know that you will deduct, they typically mark up their prices to accommodate the WHT deductions. You are also expected to deduct value added tax (VAT) from your sale price. If two companies produce similar real estate products and all other cost of production remain the same, the company that is tax compliant will have higher production cost than the other company that does not pay WHT and VAT. This gives the tax evading company an advantage over the tax compliant one.\r\n\r\nQ: Are you saying that ineffective compliance with payment of tax encourages unfair advantage in some quarters\r\nIt does create an unfair advantage. The overall business cost of the tax evading company is lower. They have a comparatively lower wage cost, as staff would have demanded for more pay if they were deducting personal income tax and other statutory deductions. In addition, they pay little or no corporate income tax and education tax on their profit before tax. The overall implication is that the tax evading company, producing exactly the same quality of real estate products with a tax compliant company, can mark their sale price down by up to 30% in view of these unwholesome gains; thus securing a huge market advantage. When this situation persists, the tax compliant operators may not see the need to continue on the right path since other operators are getting away with fortune, while they struggled. If the tax compliant company still intends to stick to the right path, it may be compelled to withdraw from the market, as it may not be able to compete.\r\n\r\nThe system has succeeded in rewarding crookedness and the entire society suffers!\r\nAs a practitioner in real estate, you see this unfair advantage played out in other areas to the detriment of those who want to do the right thing. For instance, when it comes to development matters and planning regulations, you see the non-compliant operators having clear advantage.\r\n\r\nQ: How does this affect competition for development opportunity?\r\n\r\nThe non-compliant operators indulge in gross and brazen violation of setback, density and land use rules. When competing for a development opportunity with them, you may lose out because you will not be able to come up with as much development units as these non-compliant operators who disregard density and setback rules.\r\nSimilarly, you may not be able to produce retail outlets on purely residential parcel. The non-complaint operators win, and typically they get away with these infractions.\r\nUnfortunately, you may also lose out as rules-complying operator when competing for tract development. While you are insisting to the potential partners (usually land owners) that estate layout be produced, your competitors are not that mindful.\r\n\r\nQ: There have always been controversies on the issue of compliance with layout in Nigeria as most houses are built at variance with the approved layout.\r\n\r\nProducing estate layout requires part of the land will go for infrastructure, landscape and other facilities. The land owners want more land for development, disregarding critical minimum standard that will make for good built environment. While you are still pontificating on the need for standard, your competitors are already on site clearing. Usually there are no adverse consequences to them.\r\n\r\nThe situation of uneven playing field is further compounded by unaccountable operators (typically individuals), who are usually in gross violation of planning rules and their tax responsibilities. Unfortunately, the market that is buying cares more about pricing and not about the ethical standard of an operator. You notice a similar situation even among building materials’ vendors where vendors of quality and standard materials have left the market or have joined the non-compliant out of necessity to continue in business.\r\n\r\nQ : In specific term, how  does the violation of urban development rules affect real estate businesses ?\r\n\r\nWe have unfortunate instances where huge real estate investment are sadly undermined by activities which are in clear violation of planning, environmental, traffic and other laws of public decency. Sporadic markets, motor cycle parks, shanties, etc have emerged to create blight, threatening millions of naira investment in real estate projects. Investors are left in virtual financial ruins by activities that are not only extremely fringe in value but environmentally degrading. The sheer lawlessness on our roads, almost with impunity in some areas, has virtually locked down investment in these locations. People are reluctant to take up real estate products in such places due to surrounding blight and\/or ordeal of daily commuting. Investors in such locations struggled for patronage, while demand pressure builds up in areas of relative sanity, leading to overpricing and overdevelopment among other unpleasant consequences.\r\n\r\nQ: What then should be the role of the government?\r\n\r\nGovernment has the responsibility of promoting law, order and public good. The benefits to all are clearly seen in places where compliance is treasured. We cannot possibly build the society of our dream when businesses operating outside the clear provisions of laws and regulations are allowed to thrive. While the government might not have taken action to support lawlessness, its sheer omission to act decisively and consistently for all to see is enough incentive for deviant behavior.\r\n\r\nI believe with a renewed commitment to enforcement, due process and fairness on the part of government, we will begin to see enthusiastic followership and loyalty on the part of the citizens. The reward will be the emergence of a better society.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Taxation and Violation of Environmental Laws","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"how-taxation-and-violation-of-environmental-laws-undermine-real-estate-industry-by-propertygates-boss","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 13:39:41","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 13:39:41","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5983","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},
{"ID":"5986","post_author":"14","post_date":"2018-07-14 12:43:04","post_date_gmt":"2018-07-14 12:43:04","post_content":"<strong>Published January 2018<\/strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nReal estate practitioners are preparing for a bumper year. Why? They say the year before an election year always triggers a lot of transactions in the real estate market. They base this on two major factors:\r\n\r\n<strong>Committed Sellers<\/strong>: Politicians looking to raise funds for campaigns will put up their properties (which ordinarily wouldn't be on the market) for sale. As committed sellers, they are not bound by the usual dictates of the real estate market. So, the asking price of their property will be lower than the market value. The result will be more properties on the market and this may affect prices.\r\n\r\n<strong>Empowered buyers:<\/strong> This is the second assumption. The suggestion here is that there will be a lot of spending on election campaigns; mobilization of delegates, publicity, commissioning of projects by those in power etc. This 'spending' will, in turn, trickle down into the hands of Nigerians who will then spend more on property.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIs the “<em>election effect<\/em>” a Myth or Reality?\r\n\r\nCastles Lifestyle decided to gather the views of expert and experienced Real Estate Practitioners in order to provide more insight into how election activities affect the real estate market.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Mr Kolawole Anunopo :<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThere is every likelihood that there will be more activities in the real estate sector this year. Those with political ambitions for next year's election are already exploring different avenues to raise campaign funds. One of the avenues is the real estate market. At the moment, some properties have already been placed on the market for quick sale. In fact, a client of mine who wants to contest for a political office in his State has instructed me to sell one of his properties as soon as possible. The request for a quick sale of the property is borne purely out of his need for bulk funds to support his campaign.\r\n\r\nAnother reason to expect more transaction in the real sector this year is Government activities.  The incumbent Government will be looking to do more towards fulfilling past promises and completing unfinished projects. Executing these projects will require that government release more funds into the system. As such, when the economy has more money in circulation, people will have more funds to buy real estate, lease or rent apartments.\r\n\r\n<em>Mr. Kolawole Anunopo is a well-respected and highly experienced real-estate practitioner. He is also the CEO of Integrated Estate Services LTD. <\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Dr Rotimi Idowu (30 years in Real Estate):<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIt's a fact that during preparation for elections, several people --in order to avoid lending from banks-- will place their property in the market. It goes without saying that elections in Nigeria are extremely monetized. You need a lot of money to contest for elective positions and posts. In this regard, a lot of new properties will join the ones we presently have on ground in the market thereby creating a glut. Whether those properties sell fast depends on the type of property and level of demand. Properties put on the market to help raise campaign funds  will have to be heavyweight properties in places like Abuja, Port Harcourt, Lagos etc.  Without a doubt, additional supply of properties by committed sellers to the existing pile will affect property price.\r\n\r\nAs a nation, Nigeria suffers a lot of CAPITAL FLIGHT. Politicians make a lot of money from the system (either through international contracts or outright lifting of funds in the country) and then take these monies abroad. However, during preparation for elections, there will be repatriation of such funds back into the country and the economy. These funds will eventually trickle down into the hands of those in charge of their campaign affairs. With more money in the hands of campaign officers, directors etc. there is a high chance that they would go on and purchase a property they might have been putting off  prior to that time.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the people seeking elective positions will not be as much as those who will benefit from the spending. For example, where a high grade property is in question, whether somebody seeking elective position is able to sell his property or not, he will look for other ways to get funds. So, it's going to be a Win-Win situation. In this case, those in the property market will benefit positively from the preparation and inevitable spending associated with election preparations.\r\n\r\n<em>Dr. Rotimi Idowu is the CEO of Rotimi Idowu Idowu &amp; Co Estate Surveyors and Valuers. He is a highly versatile and knowledgeable real estate practitioner with over 30 years of experience.<\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Mr Oyeme Silas:<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn the year preceding an election, people are usually unwilling to spend money. They would rather wait until after the election outcome before deciding to spend or not. A lot of properties will be on the market by people in need of cash. However, it is one thing to supply a property and it's another to get a buyer for the property. It will probably lead to a situation where prices of some properties will be ridiculously cheap but the question is if people will be willing to part with their money to buy such properties.\r\n\r\nWhile money from government projects and co will definitely trickle down, not a lot of people will be willing to spend their money on properties immediately. Some of them will want to keep the money and see how the political system plays out. Some people will also decide to use the money for other things.\r\n\r\nTrue, there are clients who are ready to buy properties with the money they've realized from the election. However, before the election, most of them will be unwilling to spend on properties, preferring to adopt a wait-and-see stance. In fact, when advised to buy a property because it is very cheap now, they would maintain their stance. This cautiousness can be attributed to their uncertainty regarding the election outcome.\r\n\r\nThose who have political interests, and are confident about the chances of their candidate in the election, might be less averse to spending on property. Because, once their candidate wins, it means more money and opportunity to purchase properties. On the other hand, those who feel less confident about their chances will rather wait to see what happens after the whole electioneering process is completed before making real estate decisions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, most of them will be only be willing to make  investment properties transactions. They would rather purchase blocks of flats that they can rent out or office spaces that they can put on lease.\r\n\r\nWhile politicians will not buy properties in the pre-election period, they will most certainly take out rents and lease properties for use as campaign offices, headquarters and mobilization base.\r\n\r\nSummarily, in the first quarter of this year, there will always be transaction because those in the public and private sector will want to buy properties. A lot of those who arrived the country last year will also want to buy properties before they return overseas. So, the property business will move between now and the end of march. After the end of march, everybody will divert attention towards the election resulting in slow property purchases. Nonetheless, short-lettings and leasing are expected to flourish.\r\n\r\n<em>Mr Oyeme Silas is the CEO of Oyeme Silas &amp; Co.

{"ID":"5988","post_author":"14","post_date":"2018-07-14 12:46:24","post_date_gmt":"2018-07-14 12:46:24","post_content":"<strong>Published April 2018<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIt was forty years on the 29<sup>th<\/sup> of March 2018 that the Land Use Decree known as Decree 6 of 1978 was promulgated by the General Olusegun Obasanjo’s regime. Barely a year later, the decree was made part of the Nigerian constitution before the hand over to the civilian Government of Alhaji Shehu Shagari and therefore became an Act. As a student of the University of Ife now Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), I wrote an article on the decree which was published by the Nigerian Tribune on May 12<sup>th<\/sup> and 13<sup>th<\/sup> 1978. I had expressed my reservations on the new law then pointing out several areas of concern. In subsequent articles thereafter I continued to call for a review of the law in order to correct some areas of concern. On April 27<sup>th<\/sup> 1998, I wrote a particular article in <strong>T<\/strong>he Guardian where I highlighted ten (10) areas that needed examination and review. Today, 40 years after no part of the law has ever been reviewed because of the intricacies involved in constitutional amendment! Calls for the removal of the Act from the constitution have all fallen on deaf ears! For the umpteenth time, I am again drawing the attention of the National Assembly (NASS) to this law which affects the generality of Nigerians more than the order of election, which had become a matter of do or die for some of our “Honorable” members of recent.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nImagine a law made forty years ago which vested all lands in the state in the “MILITARY GOVERNOR” of the state! There is the need to amend this sentence to simply read “GOVERNOR” since we are no longer under a military junta. I wonder why nobody has gone to court to challenge any of the civilian governors for operating under a law that allows only military governors to operate it.\r\n\r\nThe law vested all land in any state in the Military Governor of the state without giving the Federal Government power to acquire land in the states. Before the law, the power of “eminent domain” existed for the Federal Government to invoke if it needed to acquire land in any part of the Federation for overriding public purposes. Under the Land Use Act, the Federal Government must go and beg the states for land in order to do anything in the state no matter how important it is to National affair. I think the Federal Government should have an unfettered access to land in any part of the Federation for public uses.\r\n\r\nThe law only allows a person to own a maximum of half a hectare of undeveloped land at any particular time. This is not good for estate developers who need several hectares to develop houses which they sell to the public. All allocations that have been done to developers or industrialist which exceed half a hectare is a violation of the law. There is therefore the need to distinguish between individuals and corporate bodies who should be allowed to acquire large parcels of land for industrial or estate development.\r\n\r\nThe law had made provisions for the establishment of land use and allocation committees for the purposes of advising the governors on the management and allocation of land in their states. As at today, I am not aware that any state has such a committee. This has given room to the Governor being the sole allocator of land who may give land to only those whose faces he likes! This is not the intention of the law. It does not seek to create a monopoly of the authority to allocate land. The law should therefore be amended to make it compulsory for the state governors to always have a Land Use and Allocation Committee in place for the allocation of land to be valid. This will curb the abuses we have witnessed all over the country in the way state land is being distributed to family members and cronies of the governors only.\r\n\r\nThe clause on Governor’s consent to all subsequent transactions need to be revisited as it has become a cog in the wheel of progress in the process of transfer of interest in land in some states. Some states have turned it into a money making exercise by demanding a very high percentage of the value of the land as consent fees. It used to be 15% in Lagos State but has been reduced now to 3% which to me is still too high! Besides the monetary payment, the process of obtaining this “almighty” consent can be very tortuous and time consuming. The clause should be expunged or set a procedure which will be less cumbersome and expensive.\r\n\r\nThe aspect that deals with compensation for land whose certificate of occupancy (C of O) has been revoked is the most unfair and oppressive of the whole law; (Section 29-33). For example, it limits compensation to only improvements on the land and ground rent paid in the year of acquisition! This means that if you buy a piece of land in, say Lekki phase 1 today for hundred million Naira and while you are perfecting your title (going through the complex route of obtaining governors consent and building approval), the land is acquired for public purposes, you will be entitled to compensation for only the ground rent paid in the year of acquisition. You will not be compensated for the purchase price which you paid at all!\r\n\r\nIt goes further to say that if you are provided an alternative to your acquired property and the value of the alternative is higher than the value of your property, you shall be made to pay the difference. But if it is lower, you will not be entitled to the difference! The principle of compensation is to put you in the same position as you were before your property was acquired. Above cannot do that. There is therefore the need to revisit this section and make it more equitable and fair to all concerned as the Rotarians say!\r\n\r\nIn addition, with some states such as Lagos state, now using a Land Use Charge in place of Ground rent, does it then mean that such a person whose land has been acquired is not entitled to any compensation whatsoever, since ground rent no longer exists?!\r\n\r\nSome part of the Land Use Act, especially the area of compensation, is in conflict with the constitution. The 1979 constitution has provided that “no person’s property shall be acquired without adequate compensation”. Section 29 – 33 of the Land Use Act does not make provision for adequate provision, thereby creating a conflict. Since the Land Use Act has been made part of the same constitution, this conflict must be removed.\r\n\r\nThere has also been a little controversy over the real status of a C of O! Is it a title to land or a <u>mere evidence of occupation<\/u> of the land as the name suggests? Sometimes ago, a minister of the federal Capital Territory (FCT) woke up one day and cancelled or revoked all C of Os on all lands in the FCT because some were defective or obtained fraudulently! All allottees were then directed to recertify their documents and get another C of O. If the C of Os were title like the previous land certificate or deed of conveyance, it would not have been possible to cancel them by such a mere directive.\r\n\r\nSince the promulgation of the decree, banks and other financial institutions have not been accepting bare land (no matter the size and value) as collateral for loans and advances, despite the high price paid to purchase same. This is as a result of the compensation clause which has nothing for the owner of bare land if C of O is revoked! These has been a source of serious problem for those who have land and will like to use it as collateral for loans either to develop the land or for other businesses. The value of the land can be greater than the value of the development on the land in most high end locations. It is therefore not right to ignore the value of the land and pay compensations only on the land. As private citizens, this is one more way that the Land Use Act is unfavourable towards the housing development in the country.\r\n\r\nThe Land Use Decree has been operated for 40years and we have all seen the areas that need amendment in other to reduce the inconveniences and illegalities contained therein. The National Assembly must therefore take a serious look at the law and either set in motion the machinery to carry out a review or remove the law from the constitution to make it amenable to review as and when the need arises.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"The land use decree. 40 years on!","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"the-land-use-decree-40-years-on","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 13:39:37","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 13:39:37","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5988","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},
{"ID":"5991","post_author":"14","post_date":"2018-07-14 12:50:08","post_date_gmt":"2018-07-14 12:50:08","post_content":"<strong>Published April 2018<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> <\/strong>\r\n\r\n2017 was not exactly a great year for real estate. Financing for real estate projects was virtually unavailable and when the banks considered such projects, interest rates were set at a discouraging 24% and above. New foreign investment was almost negligible. The retail market and office sector suffered from over supply and low demand resulting in high vacancy rates and poor returns for landlords\/investors. On the positive side (depending on one’s perspective), land prices enjoyed modest increases.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWill 2018 be different? This will be dependent on if the conditions that subsisted in 2017 change or not.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lending Rates:<\/strong>\r\n\r\nLending rate toward the sector ranged between 22% and, as high as, 24% in 2017 indicating a disinclination by banks to finance real estate projects. This lack of enthusiasm and unwillingness was due to two main factors: large number of  non-performing real estate loans within the banking system, leaving a lot of banks with collateral properties  that had depreciated well below their original loan value and an appetite for less risky Treasury Bills at with yields at 18%. Is this the current position as we start 2018?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnalysts offer mixed views. Mr. Eyitayo Olabode (Head, Real Estate and Construction Guaranty Trust Bank) opines that lending rates will remain in double digits. He also states that it is very likely that banks will continue to have a preference for Treasury Bills in 2018 against lending to real estate developers and if there is any change at all, it would be negligible as government will continue to “drive a high price regime in order to protect foreign exchange.” Despite his thoughts that banks will continue to maintain their reluctance, he believes that with Government intervention, there might be a change of attitude to lending real estate. “If government says banks should not have more than 20% of their assets in Treasury Bills, it means the balance sheet structure has been constricted so much that banks will need to take in more loans. Government should create an intervention fund that will drive the real estate industry. This is necessary because of the importance of Real estate to the economy and solving real life problems.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGiving his own view, Mr. Munachi  Okoye (Managing Director of MCO Real Estate (MCORE) believes that lending rates will come down a little because of inflation is on a gradual downward trend, encouraging CBN to give a little to stimulate growth. “Treasury Bills rates are already coming down  from the 18%  high of 2017 making banks look a bit more favourably towards lending to the real sector.” Mr. Munachi concluded by saying that he believes banks will at least grant audience to and consider loan applications from the real sector.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Foreign Investment:<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFor international investors, the volatility of the exchange rate for the dollar  has always been the point of reference as far as return on their investment is concerned. For U.S and European retailers, the 2017 conditions of fluctuating oil prices along with an unstable local currency value, and a highly inflated recessive economy, did not represent optimal conditions for investment. According to Broll (one of Africa’s leading commercial property services company), enquiries and demand from retailers in Far and Middle-Eastern countries spiked as they looked to take advantage of hesitant U.S and European retailers in a bid to gain stronghold in the Nigerian retail market. MINISO,  a Chinese retailer  that specializes in household and consumer goods, commenced trading in the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> quarter and they stand out as an example of a few of these Far and Middle Eastern retailers whose interest resulted in active negotiation and concluded leasing transactions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEven though industry experts believe foreign investors will remain cautious given the supply already in the market, they cite stabilized foreign exchange, oil price, the country’s emergence from recession and receding inflation as grounds for the real sector to be optimistic about looking forward to the arrival of foreign investors. The hope, nonetheless, is that oil prices remain stable so that the country can continue to accrue the foreign reserves needed to stabilize the Naira. Once they begin to come in, it is expected that foreign investors will show high interest in the hospitality sector due to the oversupply in other real estate sectors.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Retail and Office Sector<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe overriding factor in commercial property space in 2017 was oversupply. Projects were completed and started competing with a very shallow pool of tenants. In many cases, it was the same tenants moving from one new Grade A office space to another. Couple with the amount of office space on the market was the declining demand from tenants. Corporates tightened their belts by reducing staff (and space) and considering both Grade B properties as well as locations outside Ikoyi and Victoria Island. Indeed, in 2017, the commercialization of Lekki Phase 1 and Oniru Estates moved into high gear with virtually all the banks having significant branches in both locations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe result according to  Broll’s 2017 Q3 Office Market Report, was landlords had to take steps such as, “rent concession,  and longer rent-free periods” in order to retain existing tenants and to market new tenants.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe retail sector also faced similar issue of surplus supply and inadequate demand and as a result, vacancies became an issue especially in the new malls. The result as in the Office sector was that landlords had to offer lower rents, longer rent free periods and lower to fixed exchange rates.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are two schools of thought regarding the commercial office sector. The first points out to the over 44,000sqm of additional space that will be added in 2018 and opine that landlords will face even tougher times in 2017, The second believes that despite the oversupply, economic growth will drive demand for more space and this will have the impact of rents ‘bottoming out’ in the year.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor the retail sector, there was a glimmer of hope because while South African, European and American retailers were moving out of Nigeria or shelving their plans to site their stores here, there was renewed interest from retailers in Turkey and the Far East. Mimiso, a retailer from the Far East took up over 4,000sqm in retail space in the last half of 2017 and has an appetite for more stores. If such retailers can be encouraged to set up shop in Nigeria and their goods are well received, we could see the retail sector start booming again.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Prime Land Prices:<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAccording to MCORE, prices remained stable in 2017 showing a 1% growth in Naira and Dollar terms with Oniru showing the strongest growth of 10% while Victoria Island fell by 5%. Of the prime lands tracked by MCORE in 2017, Eko Atlantic remained the most expensive due to its infrastructure and dollar transaction benchmark. The gap between Victoria Island, Ikoyi and Banana Island prices narrowed with a 4% range in relation with each other.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGenerally, land prices are not expected to increase drastically. Eko Atlantic and Victoria Island are not expected to show much growth in prices. The reason postulated for this projection is that Eko Atlantic, being on the top of the price range represents a daunting challenge for developers in a convalescing market while Victoria Island as a mature market will experience little growth. Additionally, the commercial office market in Victoria Island is not currently doing well; hence, there’s no tangible driver for it to show appreciation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLekki phase 1 is expected to show strong price growth in 2018, attracting local and foreign demand because of its commercial and residential market mix.

We know, we know, it’s YOUR house but hear us out first. We’ll spare you all the long, boring scientific details but it’s a proven fact that what our immediate environment looks like affects how we feel and our ability to function effectively.\r\n\r\nHow did you feel the last time you walked into a hotel lobby or restaurant that reminded you of a scene from The Great Gatsby? Or maybe saw one in a magazine or on TV? You might not have time to take in every little detail, but something about it just leaves you soaring on the inside.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat if we told you that you could get that same feeling every time you opened your bedroom door? Our bedrooms are perhaps the only spaces in our homes we can truly call ‘ours’, depending on a number of factors like whether you share it with siblings, a roommate, spouse or children below the age of 3, whether you’re a home owner or tenant etc. However, what you want to do is ensure that you “own your space”.\r\n\r\nToday, we’ll be sharing a few helpful tips to help add interest to your bedrooms (these will also be helpful considerations when dealing with clients) by simply turning your walls into your very own canvas. The great news is that these changes are not necessarily permanent, and you can ‘update’ them at the lowest possible cost. They are also in <strong>different categories depending on age and gender<\/strong>. Today, we’ll be focusing on Master Bedrooms.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Master Bedrooms<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe master bedroom may or may not be occupied by a couple. It belongs to the owner of the house, is usually the largest, and en-suite.\r\n\r\n<strong>1.Curtains: Lengths, Texture, Colour…<\/strong>\r\n\r\nCurtains that drop from the ceiling can give off a very regal look. Care should however be given to the choice of texture, colour and pattern. Plain curtains with patterns you only see from up-close tend to look a lot more ‘modern’ than organic or geometric ones but whatever you choose, you can’t go wrong with the right colours.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>2.Wall Paint: Mix and Match<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAs far as paint goes, try to keep it as simple as possible. Not everyone is a fan of all-white walls but they aren’t rare in modern bedroom designs. Beige, ivory, cream, or light grey work well, with other brighter colours. If your client’s favourite colour is a really bold one, you might want to use only a touch of it with neutral colours that work well with it.\r\n\r\n<strong>3.Wall Art<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWall art always looks good above a king-sized bed especially when it’s centrally placed. Simple but classy looking wall clocks and a few framed family photos will give a homely look so be sure to add those to your list as well.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>4.Lighting: “More is More”<\/strong>\r\n\r\nHaving just one centrally-placed light source is not the most functional of choices. They tend to cast shadows. You should have several different types of light sources in different positions e.g. reading lights close to the bed and desk, task lighting close to the dressing area (or walk-in-closet), and perhaps overhead lighting with dimmer switches. If you want to keep it simple, recessed lights will do.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Author<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/chronos-studeos.com\/blog\/index.php\/author\/debbie-adef\/\">Deborah Adefolalu<\/a>\r\n\r\nDeborah is the Content Writer at Chronos Stores and Chronos Studeos.

He has property in choice areas like Ikoyi and Victoria Island but lives in a modest house in Surulere. “I can’t afford to live in such expensive areas. Rather, the rent I collect acts like my pension and so I am not a burden on my children”\r\n\r\nRental returns in Baba Fela’s time were a very good and safe source of return. Rents used to go up regularly. In the cases where the rent was stated in US dollars, it was a hedge against the depreciation of the Naira. Is that the same situation today? What advice should we give anyone looking at investing for rental returns in 2018? This is the question we will try to answer in simple terms in this article……\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n<strong>RETURNS<\/strong>:\r\n\r\nWhich property will give the best rental returns for the amount you want to spend? If two properties will cost the same amount to acquire and one will give higher rents than the other, then the investor should go for the one with the higher rent. It is important that you don’t allow emotions to cloud your judgment if you are looking at investing for rents. You don’t need to like the house; you need to like the returns!\r\n\r\nAs an investor, you also have  to compare this profitability against alternative investment options such as the stock market, treasury bills, fixed deposit etc. Rental income is usually between 5% and 10% but investment in Treasury Bills was as high as 18% at a time.\r\n\r\nHowever, investing in property for rental income is usually for the long term and over time the value of the house may increase. This is called capital gains. But you cannot get the capital gains until you sell the house. So the investor must weigh all these in considering purchasing a house for rental income.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>RISKS: <\/strong>Another factor you have to consider are the associated risks that might prevent you from getting your return. Fire, vandalism etc are potential risks to the property, although they are rare. Other issues may not affect your property directly but can impact the rents you get. An example is the Badoo cult in Ikorodu may make people leave your house in that area even though they have not been attacked.\r\n\r\nMore common problems are:  non-paying tenants and void periods (when you are unable to get tenants into your property). Most Landlords can relate to the experience of having an unreasonable tenant. A stubborn tenant might decide to stay put in your house without paying rent. The landlord loses the income from the rent and he has to spend money to get the tenant out. A landlord in this situation would wish he had invested in fixed deposit or Treasury Bills\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>COSTS OF HOLDING THE INVESTMENT: <\/strong>\r\n\r\nThere are costs involved in holding property as an investment. Generally, there are some obligations landlords have to meet. Painting the exterior of the house, keeping the house wind and watertight are some examples.\r\n\r\nBut there are some costs that are not obvious. For instance, you buy an apartment in 1004 Estate in Victoria Island, you will have to pay service charge if tenants are not in the property. Otherwise, you risk accumulating the service charge. In fact, it is double trouble when you have an uncooperative tenant who has refused to pay the service charge or leave your house. When such tenant eventually leaves, the onus is on you to clear the accumulated service charge before a new tenant comes in.\r\n\r\nLandlords in the high end locations like Ikoyi have found out that when tenants leave, they have to commit substantial funds to ‘updating’ the property. If not, they will not attract tenants. These are all cost against the house and borne by the Landlord. In essence, while we say the return is the rent as a percentage of the cost of the house at the time you bought it, in reality, you should include these other costs. Effectively, it could mean that your return can be far lower than the initial calculation obtained when other costs are factored in.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor many people, rent is considered almost foolproof, some people see as their pension, constant source of income etc. But the market itself is changing and landlords have to keep up with the times in terms of how they can ensure they get the best rent.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"A Layman's Guide to Real Estate Investment (1)","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"a-laymans-guide-to-real-estate-investment-1-what-the-21st-century-landlord-has-to-know","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 13:39:14","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 13:39:14","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=6005","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

This meant that we could all park our cars comfortably in the compound. The two expatriates had a Toyota truck each, Ejike and Emeka, the two bankers had three cars each and we had our slightly battered Honda Civc.

It was not the ideal situation but at least the expatriates were not complaining.

I managed to calm her down and things went fairly smoothly.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nThen one day, we got home to find a bus parked in the slot for vacant unit. It had the name of one of the popular Pentecostal churches on its side. Olufunmilayo Olusola went ballistic. She got out of the car and went directly to Ejike’s apartment. His wife opened the door.\r\n\r\n“What is that bus doing in this compound?” Olufunmilayo Olusola, queried the woman.\r\n\r\n“Oh” the woman squealed in delight. “Emeka is now a full pastor, so we are in charge of the church bus. Since there is free space here, we decided to bring it home.”\r\n\r\n“So you will be parking four vehicles in this compound?” Olufunmilayo Olusola’s tone was icy.\r\n\r\nShe started sprouting something about Obed Edom and the ark and how the bus will bring blessings to the compound.\r\n\r\nOlufunmilayo Olusola turned on her heel and motioned that I was to come with her and say no more.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were alone, I asked her why she went to Emeka’s house instead of Ejike’s.\r\n\r\n“Ejike could have been the one who parked the bus.”\r\n\r\n“No. You see Ejike responded with empathy and concern over Toye’s, emm, plight.

The length of the bus meant that Sam could not reverse from his spot until Emeka moved the bus. Emeka had taken his time to get out and this had led to a flaming row. The long and short of it was that Sam banned Emeka from his (Sam’s) extra parking slot and Emeka simply moved into the extra space originally meant for Toye.\r\n\r\nOlufunmilayo Olusola’s entreaties to Emeka to understand that he could not appropriate four slots instead of two, were ignored by him.\r\n\r\nI should have expected it.\r\n\r\nI got home two nights later to utter chaos in the compound.

He returned to the compound a sober man but now with just two cars. He had to sell his Land Rover to meet his legal fees. He was now ‘behaving’,  Olufunmilayo Olusola, grimly commented.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI was flabbergasted. What was happening in this compound? Could my wife have been orchestrating all these calamities on our tenants? Her father had all the connections in Nigeria. He could do and undo. I had seen some of his steel in Olufunmilayo Olusola, when she negotiated some contracts on his behalf. One day, I saw her gaze fixated on Ejike, the only tenant left with three cars, instead of the two permitted by the lease.\r\n\r\n“What are you planning against Ejike?” I used the element of surprise to shock a response out of her.\r\n\r\nThere it was. I saw it. There was a flash of surprise in her eyes and I could see she was calculating on the best way to answer me.\r\n\r\n“Whatever do you mean darling?” she moved close to me brushing off some imaginary lint on my suit.\r\n\r\nI was clear that she was going to use her feminine powers of persuasion to get out of this. I moved out of her reach. Her devastating beauty and personality, which made me propose to her a few hours after meeting her.\r\n\r\n“Nothing suspicious should happen to Ejike. I know you are upset about the parking habits of our tenants but this is not a Godfather movie. Strange things cannot keep happening to our tenants”\r\n\r\n“Darling, sweetheart, sugar blossom. Whatever are you thinking? That I am behind all what happened to Toye and Emeka? Me? This small girl” As she was saying this, she was moving to wards me and I was backing down, until she had me pinned to a corner.\r\n\r\n“If anything happens to Ejike, I will know that you are behind it” I kept my wits about me.\r\n\r\nShe put her hands up in mock surrender. “I don’t know what you are talking about but I will guard Ejike with my life” she said dramatically.\r\n\r\nA few days later, I got home to see several cars in the compound. Some had the logo of the bank where Ejike works on them. This was the last straw. I charged into Ejike’s apartment demanding why he should have parked in all the slots. He was surprised and denied the charge. I insisted that he come out and see.\r\n\r\n“These are the protocol cars of my Chairman and CEO. What are they doing here?”\r\n\r\nThe driver pointed to my apartment.\r\n\r\nAt that point two distinguished gentlemen, escorted by my wife, came out of the apartment.\r\n\r\n“Good evening Sir, Good evening Sir”. Ejike almost bent double to greet them.\r\n\r\nThe CEO, recognising Ejike greeted him and introduced him to the Chairman.\r\n\r\n“I hope he is not causing you any trouble at all” the Chairman said jocularly.\r\n\r\nEjike and I turned to Olufunmilayo Olusola, a silent plea in our eyes.\r\n\r\n“Not at all.” She said after a few seconds. “He is a model tenant”. Her eyes went meaningfully to Ejike’s third car.\r\n\r\nBy the next day, the third car was gone. Never to be seen again in the compound.\r\n\r\nConcluded.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Car wars (4)","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"car-wars-4","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:57:51","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:57:51","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=6024","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

That was the exact time, when I woke up to find three armed men at my bedside. Before that frightening wake up call, I was a deep sleeper: so deep that I slept through the cutting of the burglar bars and the fiddling of the lock on the bedroom door. How do you describe the feeling of opening your eyes to find yourself looking into the business end of a double barrelled gun? Then lifting your eyes and looking into the pupils of eyes straight from the pits of hell. I knew that behind those eyes was a brain calculating whether to pull the trigger or not.\r\n\r\nI wish I could say that I was heroic about it. The truth was that I did not know when I messed myself as I lost control of my bowels. I don’t know if that was the time, my family lost respect for me or when the bandits took forceful carnal knowledge of my wife and daughter. Either way, the family was never the same again after that night. My family now live in England, while due to the need to earn a living and maintain them over there I have to stay in Nigeria. It’s funny when I go abroad I sleep soundly through the night. It could be in New York with sirens blaring through the night or any equally noisy European town or even nearby Ghana. As soon as my head hits the pillow, it will be till the next morning before my eyelids open. But once I am in Nigeria, its nightmares until 3:47am.\r\n\r\nI have moved houses several times just because I heard a mere whisper that the area may not be safe or I notice a possible security risk. So I was very happy to rent a flat from a former top Police officer. There were mobile policemen at the gate of the house and the police security van always made a stop at the house anytime they were passing by. I gratefully paid over and above the rental rates for that area and moved in. it did not matter that the water was not running all the time or the services were atrocious, the sight of four <em>mopol<\/em> guarding the house was all the facilities management I needed.\r\n\r\nThen disaster struck. There was a probe into my landlord’s activities in the Force and before I knew it, the <em>mopol <\/em>were removed and the police patrols stopped. It was then I realised how exposed the house was. The burglar bars were very flimsy, the doors were mere wooden doors and not security doors and worse, there was an opening in the ceiling, through which the plumber was to get to the water tanks. A point of access to the tanks from inside the flat could also be the way an enterprising assailant could get into the flat.\r\n\r\nI immediately started looking for another apartment. Is this how other armed robbery or kidnap victims also look for apartments in Lagos?  Always looking for the one with the best security? I wonder how many psychologically damaged people are out there…..like me, seeing  only the security threat in any house? Can’t someone lose his mind this way?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>","post_title":"I cannot help it if I am afraid.","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"i-cannot-help-it-if-i-am-afraid","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:57:41","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:57:41","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=6037","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

We had been dating for six years and although I had proposed to her and had told both our families unofficially that we were a couple, we had not actually set a date.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI must admit that the delay in getting to the altar was entirely my fault as Chinwe was ready to become my Mrs at any time of my choosing. I, on the other hand was of the opinion that a man must be financially buoyant before taking a wife. Immediately I proposed I started making saving up and making investments that would make our marriage start on solid ground. I invested heavily in the stockmarket, which was booming at the time and was on my way to meeting my financial goals when my Dad died. This setback meant that I, the only male  child had to meet most of the funeral expenses. I had to spend millions, some of which were borrowed funds.This meant that all my marriage plans had come to nought. I had to start again.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nChinwe was very sympathetic and supportive but pointed out that my delay had meant that my Dad had not witnessed our marriage. My procrastination had resulted in pushing the marriage date, time and time again that the death had occurred before the marriage. I felt bad but was all the more resolved that my marriage would take off on a sound financial footing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI decided to move jobs from the banking sector to a telecommunications company. With the way the sector was booming, it seemed that the sky was the limit for a sharp professional like me. All was going well at first- I got some incredible bonuses and a large loan from my old bank. I am ashamed to say here that I fell for the MMM scheme.  I lost millions and with the burial money and loan still outstanding, I also had the harassment of debt collectors coming after me. On top of it all, as my employer's fortunes crashed, I had not been paid for about 6 months.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt was in this situation that Chinwe was now pressing for a marriage date in the next three months. I tried to show her the financial situation but she always had an answer for everything. I told her that I could not afford a while wedding and she settled for a simple registry ceremony.  On matters of things like aso ebi, wedding reception and other things important for a bride she made serious concessions. There was however one important matter I had to settle before the wedding. Our marital home. With my present financial situation I could not afford to pay the rent on our dream flat in Yaba. Chinwe's Mother overheard us and agreed to pay rent for the first two years. Chinwe jumped for joy but I was not so sure. Shouldn't a man be able to pay his own rent as a married man? Could this be held against me in future? Maybe I should postpone the wedding for one last time so I can raise the money for the rent?

God must send them a miracle tonight, just like He was demanded to send miracles last week.\r\n\r\nThe prayerful people were shouting in tongues and singing for joy, while I was battling to sleep. Sometimes, I felt slightly sinful for becoming so angry at people’s prayers, but the noise seemed like they were having the vigil in my house. My landlord’s Miracle Vigil was held every Friday from 10pm to 4am. I was a participant; my willingness had never been an issue.\r\n\r\nI had moved from my former apartment mainly because of the church down the street. They had prayer sessions twice a week and Praise Night once a week. I also participated from my bedroom. I was once pushed to the edge, I went to meet the pastor and pleaded with him to remove or reduce the volume of the microphone stationed outside his church. He looked at me like I was the devil, squinted his eyes and said in his best preachy voice, “the purpose of the microphone is to bring people closer to God. When they hear the word, they are convinced. Do you want to stop God’s work?” I had to look like a saint and reply, “No sir. But God also wants us to rest”. I said that part under my breath, afraid that he will rebuke me if I said anything again.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nI put my head under my pillow and forced myself to sleep. “O lord, enlarge my territory”, was the last prayer point I heard before I drifted to sleep for a short while, waking up 30 minutes later with a headache.  The sitting room used for the vigil was directly on top of my room. I stood up and went to the kitchen looking for what to eat. I had given up on sleep.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I saw my landlord talking to the gateman downstairs. I hurriedly went to meet him. We exchanged greetings and I wanted to tell him how I couldn’t sleep during the vigil but I felt a little ashamed to speak my mind. I later told him, “Ah! That vigil was so powerful, I couldn’t sleep.”\r\n\r\nHe just smiled and said he hoped I prayed along with them. I nodded. The gateman must have sensed my sarcasm, which the landlord chose to ignore and smirked with his head bowed. My head still ached and I had a meeting at the office in an hour. I went to prepare my slides for the meeting. I had planned to prepare them early in the morning, after a good night’s sleep, but it seemed that the Miracle Vigil was now every Friday.\r\n\r\nFor the next one month, I hardly slept on Fridays. The problem was I had meetings almost every Saturday; therefore, I was always drowsy and had a splitting headache.\r\n\r\nI tried changing the room I slept in, but there was no significant difference. It seemed these people now moved to every part of the house to pray. Their impact could be felt everywhere. I tried to plead with the landlord, telling him that maybe all the, ‘Blood of Jesus’ shouts could be reduced. I wondered why other tenants didn’t complain and later found out that although the sound was not as loud as mine from their side of the compound, they had devised means to deal with the landlord’s excesses. One tenant said he moved in with his friend on Fridays to have a peaceful night. Another said I should be happy it wasn’t into voodoo that was practised every night. She went further to tell me tales of her former landlord.\r\n\r\nAm I to move because of my landlord? I think there should be tenant laws against this kind of disturbance? How can we develop without respecting the privacy of others?  The Lagos State Government has promulgated laws against noise pollution from religious bodies but what about private night vigils?\r\n\r\nComments to enquiries@castlesweekly.com\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"My prayer warrior Landlord","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"my-prayer-warrior-landlord","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:57:40","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:57:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=6043","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

I used to live in a miniflat around Owode area with my wife and two kids before problems started with the landlord. I had some arrears on the rent which I promised to pay up soon but the man got impatient and threw us out of the apartment six months ago.\r\n\r\nFortunately, at about the same time, Mr. Schlong was transferred to Ghana as the new Regional Head for West Africa. Just before he left, I told him about my predicament and he asked me to move into his four bedroom duplex in <strong>Ikoyi<\/strong> since he still has a year and half on his rent. The landlord had refused to refund the balance rent as he was worried that he may not be able to let out the <strong>property<\/strong>. I was grateful for his generosity and we moved in the day after he left.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nThe <strong>house<\/strong> was beautiful and my children, Tayo, 13, and Sola, 15, had their own rooms for the first time in their lives. The big 27KVA ‘silent’ generator that powered the house was still available and that was where trouble started for me. After a week of running the generator, we were out of diesel. Calculating diesel costs meant we needed to find an alternative and we switched to the ‘I-better-pass-my-neighbour’ we brought from our former apartment. With this, we suddenly became a nuisance to the quiet neighbourhood because you hardly notice when there is no power as all the generators come on silently and automatically. As for the swimming pool and DSTV, we did not bother to use them when we found out the cost of maintaining these facilities. We could only use two of the twelve air-conditioners in the house. Do you know the cost of servicing one air conditioner?! We could not use the gas cooker – it was just too expensive. So we resumed using the kerosene stove. The soap for the washing machine was way out of our budget. Also apparently, the cost of electricity is more in these highbrow areas – so I was shocked at the electricity bills of this size of house! I only had to pay for the lighting of two rooms before but here there were four rooms, five bathrooms, two living rooms, a large kitchen and a study, whose lights were draining me. I got my family to switch all of them off at night only to find out that the security lights were a major cost on the electricity bill.  My wife and I were just learning how expensive it is to live in a big house\r\n\r\nSix months into the use of the place and my kids are already getting used to the standards of the area and now despise me for not being able to afford the upkeep of the house. Anytime I have to put on our little generator, they just grunt and head off to bed. As if that was not enough, I have been harassed by the neighbourhood security men who often take me for a loiterer anytime I take a stroll. The look on the faces on some residents of the area when they drive past me in their flashy cars also reveals a lot of disdain as if I were an unwanted intruder.\r\n\r\nI’m already tired of the whole situation and I still don’t have enough saved up for another apartment. I won’t be due for a loan at work until next two years after I pay up the present one I’m servicing. The only other option I have is to move in with my mother-in-law at her house in Ikorodu. She is a nice woman and wouldn’t complain but I’m very reluctant to take that option. This place is turning into a nightmare for me and my family but I don’t know what to do.

Read very closely and you will find that the Estate Agency is actually referring to a Servants Quarters (Boys Quarters) which has been ‘done up’ to look like a flat. Now how is this information of any use to you if you require a duplex in the said Dolphin Estate? Well, the Estate Agent is offering 4 bedroom Dolphin Duplexes (with 3 rooms BQ) at N3.5m and N4m per annum. If you do the maths, you will come to the calculation that, if you have no need of the servants quarters and you sub-let it, your actual rent will be significantly reduced to N2.3m\/N2.8m. That is a third off the rental rates!\r\n\r\nWe have found that there is strong demand by singles for such accommodation in the upmarket areas of Ikoyi, Lekki, Victoria Island and central parts of the Mainland. These, invariably young and employed singles trade off space for proximity to their places of work and the lure of an impressive address. So a number of renters who are feeling the pinch of the times have resorted to subletting their servants quarter. That way, they reduce their rental costs significantly.\r\n\r\nFor the Tenant who wants to sub-let there are some hurdles to cross. First, there is the legal hurdle of the clause in your Tenancy Agreement prohibiting you from sub-letting without the consent of your Landlord. If you want to part with the BQ of the property you want to let ensure that this clause is not inserted in the document. What Landlords insist on usually is that the tenant cannot sublet without the consent of the Landlord but that the consent must not be unreasonably refused.\r\n\r\nThe second hurdle is getting the right type of Sub-tenant. You are going to be living in close proximity to this person and will be sharing your compound with him\/her. There must be detailed rules agreed to from the start and you must ensure that the person has the character to abide by the rules.\r\n\r\nIt’s not that easy to get 34% off your rent!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>","post_title":"Saving on rental costs – Nigerians devise new strategies","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"saving-on-rental-costs-nigerians-devise-new-strategies","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:57:28","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:57:28","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=6049","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

It is even more annoying to discover the uneven steps can be easily avoided if basic care and attention to detail was given during the construction period. Concrete stairs are built by pouring concrete into a wooden (usually) formwork which reinforcement (steel rods) have been placed. When the concrete hardens, the formwork is removed. It is not rocket science to understand that if the concrete stairs will take the shape of the formwork.\r\n\r\nSo it therefore stands to reason to ensure that the formwork, which is to be built by a carpenter, is built to the exact specifications of the drawings. The risers steps must be of the same height, width and depth. Even an untrained eye would be able to see that if the boxes that make up the stairs are not even. Do not accept that any mistakes will be corrected during casting (the pouring of the concrete) as this is a case of ‘what you see is what you get’.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough that the risers are all even. ‘Accidents’ can happen during casting so the carpenter must ensure that good strong wood planks are used and they are braced properly. This is to ensure that the formwork is rigid during casting: otherwise the concrete will take whatever shape the formwork moves to. The workmen pouring the concrete must take great care to ensure that the concrete is poured evenly and any movement of the formwork must be reported with the carpenter in place to repair the breach.\r\n\r\nEnsure that the concrete is properly set before the form work is removed and you should have perfectly even stairs. The threads (the top of the stairs should be leveled into evenly. Some builders argue that uneven stairs can be corrected by chiseling and during the tile laying process. It is true that some remedial work can be undertaken at this stage but it can never beat the results that would be obtained if things were done properly the first time.\r\n\r\n<strong>Even steps takeaways<\/strong>\r\n• Ensure that the carpenter is <strong>experienced.<\/strong>\r\n<strong>•<\/strong> Use good strong wood\/planks to build the formwork\r\n• Make sure the formwork is rigid\r\n• Care must be taken during casting and any movement of the formwork reported and repaired\r\n• Threads must be leveled.\r\n• Allow concrete to set properly before removing formwork.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>","post_title":"How do I get even steps in a staircase?","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"how-do-i-get-even-steps-in-a-staircase","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:55:46","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:55:46","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=6114","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

There is a common saying that ‘you have to be able to carry yourself before you can carry someone or something else. This assertion is also valid for structures. They have to possess enough strength to support themselves and even more to resist any other external or internal forces that might want to impede on their integrity or destabilize them whichever way and they must be able to do so throughout their estimated life span for them to be considered safe structurally. There are no excuses for building collapse especially occasioned by negligence or human error hence the need to get it right at all times.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nThe provision for reinforcement in the column shown in the picture (case study) was inadequate hence the column began to buckle under load from inside out. The process of buckling would normally begin with the reinforcement inside the structural member which can be likened to the ‘skeleton of a human body’, that explains why you can see the reinforcing bars bending inside the concrete. As they struggle under the burden of excess load, they begin to bend in a certain direction usually of least resistance. With increased stresses along the member, the bending moment increases and the concrete also begin to bend in that direction also. With time you notice a slight tilt from say a perfectly vertical position (for columns) and from a perfectly horizontal position (for beams). As the burden of the load on it increases, the tilt begins to go wayward; this becomes very obvious to observers. If not checked and corrected, the member might fail totally, leading to a collapse. Columns aren’t just built, each of them are designed to carry a certain amount of load which if in excess can cause them to fail. For instance a column designed to support a maximum load of 70kN should not be subjected to load greater than 70; in the same way it is dangerous to put a 50kg bag of cement on the head of a baby boy weighing 28kg. He is most likely to crumble under the load and sustain fracture.\r\n\r\nIf a column is not constructed properly with respect to its concrete mix, moisture content, compaction, reinforcement provisions, etc. it might not meet its design strength and so becomes defective. Whatever the case, where there are defective columns or beams on a structure, it can be strengthened by a process known as Shoring and Replacement. By shoring a column you provide a temporary system to support the load on it while you remove the existing column and recast a new one in place of the old one then you disengage the temporary support once it has achieve adequate strength or alternatively you add a new column which is not surplus to requirement to the existing one and build it into the beam above it and the starter bar of the existing column as seen in the next picture. This operation is critical and you should engage a professional structural engineer to perform it successfully.\r\n\r\n<strong><em><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6136\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/This-happens-when-your-structure-is-overloaded-300x143.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"262\" \/><\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><em><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6135\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/This-happens-when-your-structure-is-overloaded-3-284x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"168\" height=\"177\" \/><\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Engr.

For the cost conscious layman it should actually be the starting point of his project. A causal discussion with a Quantity Surveyor (the professional trained to draw up a BOQ) should be able to give a rough idea of how much the cost would be. He will possibly hedge his comments stating that it relies on a number of factors and the layman should take note of these factors. One of such factors will be the quality of the soil in the area he\/she wants to build. Generally the less compact the soil, the more money would go into putting in a solid foundation to carry the weight of the building. If you want to know the cost implications of a building a bungalow on the land vis-à-vis a one storey building, you can make an informed estimate rather than assumptions which bear no resemblance to reality.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]\r\n\r\nHaving the various factors which can impact on a building cost in mind then you can give a brief more in line with your pocket to the architect who is to draw a building design. Generally three things impact on the cost of construction: the size of the structure, the finishes to be used and how intricate the design is. Even a layman will accept that a three storey building is likely to cost more than a two storey building, likewise if you use expensive materials the building cost will be higher than if cheaper materials are used. What may not be readily apparent is that the more intricate and complex a building design is, it could significantly add to the cost. Arches, decorative columns etc do not come cheap.\r\n\r\nOnce the architectural drawings are available, the BOQ can be prepared if copy of the drawings are given to a quantity surveyor. He prepares the Bill of Quantities based the on the drawings which gives the client a clue of the cost implication. If after the BOQ is prepared and the cost is beyond the budget of the client or the cost is too high then a quantity surveyor can sit with the client to reduce the cost because BOQ gives the full information that can allow for amendment; for instance at a sitting a quantity surveyor can advise on how client can down size the project. This advice might be on the quality of finishes to be used which may not require any change in the architectural drawings bit if the advice hinges on size or intricacy of building design, if the layman does not want to end up with a project he cannot complete, another visit to the architect may be required which will require changes which again should be cost against using another BOQ.\r\n\r\nAside from alerting you on the total cost of the project, the sectional cost of different stages of the project -foundation cost, ground floor cost, decking or slab, roofing cost etc also become apparent, helping the layman to plan his cash flow. Obviously some stages, for example casting the floor slab cannot be broken further and the would- be landlord has to find the entire cash (or get trade financing from the contractor) for that section. The BOQ also guides in negotiating with contractors. If a contractor’s quote substantially less for a section or the entire project then it is either your Quantity surveyor does not know what he is talking about or it is the contractor in the dark or the contractor simply does not intend to complete the job. There was the case of a layman who was supervising his own project. Any quote the contractor gave him, he would slash by 25%. Once the contractor deduced this he would quote a very high figure, the client would slash it by 25% but even at that the contractor was getting well over the normal charges for what he was doing! While the owner thought he was smart, because he did not have the right figures which a BOQ would have given him, he was just cheating himself. Working without a BOQ on your project because you want to save costs is definitely a false economy.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Bill of quantities: Counting your construction costs","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"bill-of-quantities-counting-your-construction-costs","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:55:07","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:55:07","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=6144","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Other times, the project owner may choose to be engaged directly in purchasing and organizing the supply of construction materials to their site, also in a bid to save cost. Whatever the case may be, whether it’s your personal project or as a group, it is important to know what and what you should expect at completion. You don’t plant grapes and expect to reap blueberries. A project for example, a building development is essentially a product of the use of materials and workmanship. You don’t order for tiles and expect to see epoxy flooring; neither would you see a classic brick wall when you actually paid for blocks.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6174\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Why-You-Need-a-Material-Schedule-2-1-300x152.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"823\" height=\"417\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of a material schedule is undoubted. You may never know it until you lose money buying the wrong or a substandard material at the same price as the original or even more. It is that piece of document that shows you the types, sizes, quantities, quality specifications and sometimes current price of all the materials you would need for a project from start to finish. It is not the same as a Bill of Quantities (B.O.Q) or Priced Bill of Quantities which gives brief details of all the items of work in a construction project and cost included respectively, it doesn’t give you the work item or work processes, it only deals with the materials aspect.\r\n\r\nThe Material Schedule is presented in such a way that the user can easily identify with what materials will be used in the construction of his\/her project and it often reveals approximate quantity estimates of all the materials needed with minimal allowance for wastage. Usually the material schedule is a construction document prepared after all the relevant designs\/drawings has been completed so that at no point is any material is omitted due to incomplete architectural and engineering details and a thorough market survey has been done to check availability and current prices of the required materials. It is often done in conjunction with the owner’s specifications.\r\n\r\nWhen engaging a contractor, it is important to ask for a material schedule so that you can follow up on the quality of materials used for your work. If the materials used are not those you have agreed on as duly reflected on the material schedule in the absence of a pro-work variation, you can call for a replacement. But if there are no documents to show material specifications, then you can expect anything. Sometimes regret may follow; this is particularly the case when a supplier is engaged without a material schedule to back up your claims on the specs of the materials ordered for. Take for instance, you need a simple timber (wood) to construct your roof carcass, if you don’t specify the product type, size and condition (e.g. Mahogany Hardwood, 50 x 75mm full lengths, new and smooth) but just say supply me ‘wood for roofing’ who is to blame when a truckload of used fragile softwood is brought to your site and workers begin installing them? Although the material schedule comes at a cost, it is worth it.\r\n\r\n<strong><em><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6135\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/This-happens-when-your-structure-is-overloaded-3-284x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"176\" height=\"186\" \/><\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Engr.

The most important part of a home is the interior because the ease and comfort you enjoy depends on adequate planning.\r\n\r\nFor a simple bungalow, you represent a plan on paper when you place yourself, looking at a floor plan as if you’re directly up looking down the edges of walls of the building you tends to create.\r\n\r\nAfter deciding on the type of building you want, the first thing to come to mind is the adequate land space you need to accommodate the plan in reality. You have to consider the setbacks from fence, going by town planning regulations is mostly 6m or 20ft from the property line in front to the start of building and 3m or 10ft each by both sides. Also 3m or 10ft is required at the rear as setback before the building line behind. Knowing the minimum setbacks you can now check the area and compare with you really need and if you still find more space that will be left unfilled, then is good for you to have a nice landscaping plan to complement the building this will make your building actually look nicer.\r\n\r\n<strong>How to determine room sizes<\/strong>\r\nRoom sizes actually depends on people that will occupy the rooms and the nature of traffic expected, the furniture is very important and knowing the nature of man and how he behaves will help in giving him the space adequate for him. The average sizes of man contributes to the sizes of furniture and in turn the room spaces. 600mm or 0.6m or 2 feet width is usually seen as a space an average man can fit in that’s why most modules in building are in 600mm or 2 feet, check the sizes of ceiling modules and the division of 600mm is of course 300mm which also serve as minimum circulation allowance after the normal 600mm. Therefore the standard door is put at 900mm to accommodate man and his furniture width. So for a common bedroom what you consider first are the furniture you planned to have inside based on the number of people to use them, then the doors and windows. Consider the bed, the size of wardrobe and other shelves this will help in determining sizes of the room.\r\n\r\nYou must have heard 6feet bed as very common statement, the wardrobe width space is around 600mm or 2 feet to 900mm as it may applies. For a minimum size of a room add door space 900mm or 3ft plus bed space 1.8m or 6ft plus circulation space 300mm or 1ft which equals 10ft or 3m now to add the human space of 600mm or 2ft which makes it 3.6m or 12 ft which is the standard\/acceptable minimum room size. Living room will require more furniture and expect convergence of more people compare to bedroom so function it should be the biggest space in the house (television, settees e.t.c) There is no set minimum but from experience I will say minimum should be from 4.2m or 14ft by 3.9m or 13ft. Dining requires less space because it requires less furniture and traffic , for this I will put the minimum as 2.4m derived from two seats in opposites of 0.6m each which adds up to 1.2m and table width of 0.9m plus 0.3m as circulation which makes 2.4m . For the longer side of the dining with five seats arrangements which is 5 by 0.6=3m.\r\n\r\nStaircase width minimum acceptable is 0.9m or 3ft which is the size of a door, and kitchen designs has changed a lot lately , modern designs now require bigger space with breakfast table, worktops etc\r\n\r\nConsidering the arrangements in building plan you are expected to step into the waiting room from entrance porch which can sit two people before moving to the living room or for some cases a corridor that leads to other parts of the house, this type is good if you expect exceptional visitors in your living room any other persons familiar with the house can simply take the corridor and walls straight to the other rooms as shown in pictures below.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-6190\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Floor-Layout-Basics-How-to-plan-your-building-1-300x240.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"466\" height=\"373\" \/>\r\n\r\nFrom the living room you can connect the dining directly, and from the dining next should be kitchen that has a door leading to the dining and one door leading outside of the building, this door will serve as an inlet for foodstuffs that are to be brought inside and going side by side the store and the laundry.\r\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-6191\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Floor-Layout-Basics-How-to-plan-your-building-2-300x240.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"473\" height=\"378\" \/>\r\nThese facilities should have access through the kitchen door to a bay outside where foodstuffs etc can be brought in without passing through the living room.\r\nFor a residential project, is important you have three compartments called Public, Semi Private and Private areas. Someone should be able to move from the private areas which consist mainly of bedrooms to the kitchen without you first showing up at the dining or living room to the full glare of your guests at the living room so the coordination should be this way:\r\nLIVING ROOM,WAITING ROOM-Public\r\nGUEST ROOM,DINING-Semi Private\r\nBEDROOMS,STUDY-Private\r\nKITCHEN-(In between private and semi-private)\r\nWindows also follows various sizes from 600mm for windows to 900mm,1200mm,1800mm windows as the case may apply for a tropical region like ours with erratic power supply is advisable to have two windows at different walls in a room to aid proper aeration, this will also affects arrangement of furniture and size of your rooms.","post_title":"Floor Layout Basics - How to plan your building","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"floor-layout-basics-how-to-plan-your-building","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-07-16 09:16:25","post_modified_gmt":"2018-07-16 09:16:25","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=6181","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

In the context of designing your home or other buildings, it is carried out for better function and more convenient utility of a building. The concept of zoning can be subjected to use in a number of different contexts.\r\n\r\nA design can be zoned according to the degree of access different individuals may be allowed to have to particular areas of a building. Thus one could demarcate a “public zone” in the house from the “private” or “restricted zone”. Your typical “public zone” would probably consist of the front porch, entry lobby, patio, guest toilet, living room, dining area (optionally), courtyard, verandah, den, etc; while in the same light, your typical “private zone” would probably consist of bedrooms, kitchen, family room, back entrance, bathrooms, closets, etc. “semi private” or “semi public” spaces could also be grafted out of a number of above-named spaces.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of zoning is one that is carried out according to the degree of noise permissible in a particular part of the building at any given time. Thus your home could be demarcated into a “quiet zone” and a “noisy zone” in relative terms. Bedrooms and studies obviously would fall into the former category while the living room and kitchen could relatively be associated with the latter. As above though the terms “semi-noisy” and (or) “semi-quiet” can be applied to a number of spaces (and thus designed accordingly). A site located near a busy road for example, would necessitate “quiet” areas to be located as far as possible from the road.\r\n\r\nYet another form of zoning could be carried out in terms of “wet” and “dry zones”. Thus your bathrooms, toilets, kitchen, laundry,and other spaces which make use of water would be termed “wet” while bedrooms, living, etc. would be termed “dry”. “Semi-wet” and (or) “semi-dry” would also apply as required. This sort of zoning could also present a number of cost advantages. Grouping wet areas together could reduce costs of drainage, and water supply, as well as reduce the number of inspection chambers and septic tanks required for proper waste disposal. In tiling as well, such zoning could save time and money as “wet” areas which would probably require “non-slip, vitrified” ceramic floor tiles could be laid simultaneously with similar tiles thus reducing wastage, while likewise a similar floor finish could apply for “dry” areas. Creative positioning of windows could preclude the undesirable consequences of grouping “incompatible” spaces, such as the kitchen and, say, a toilet.\r\n\r\nStill other types of zoning could exist in a building. Thus “fire-risk” zones such as the kitchen, electrical panel room, etc (are zoned away from bedrooms and escape points); “toddler zones” (with “child-proof” electric points, physical barriers to staircases and swimming pools, etc); “security zones” (relatively impenetrable during a robbery siege); and several others can be conveniently identified as requirements incorporated into the design","post_title":"Analysing Zoning in your building design","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"analysing-zoning-in-your-building-design","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-07-16 09:20:16","post_modified_gmt":"2018-07-16 09:20:16","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=6195","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

These evolu­tion has led to many options of design and construction methods of various structural components or elements of a building; such as floors, wall, and so on. The desire to construct a cost effective and safe building has also created many options for building components. For instant, there are different types of slabs like: solid slabs, hollow\/ribbed slab, waffle slab, and flat slab. So how does one choose the best type of slab for a building? what are the criteria one should look out for? Here, we will discuss the two most common floor types in Nigeria : Solid floor slab and Hollow pot slab. We will compare and contrast both slabs and attempt to advice the best to be used out of the two.\r\n\r\n<strong>WHAT IS A SLAB<\/strong>\r\n\r\nA slab is the part of a building  known as floor which divides the building into stories, usually horizontal, in building floors, roofs, bridges, and other types of structures. The slab may be supported by walls or by reinforced concrete beams.\r\n\r\nA slab can be placed on the ground can be supported by beam and soil strength capacity while a suspended slab is supported by beam, wall and column.\r\n\r\n<strong>SOLID SLAB<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSolid slab is constructed with mainly reinforcement and concrete. It can be constructed as precast or cast-insitu (monolithic solid slab construction). The solid slab construction method involves the following:\r\n\r\n<strong>Formwork construction<\/strong>: Platform to support the slab and other activities during construction.\r\n\r\nIt can be removed only when the concrete slab attain its maximium strength after 28days according to British standard.\r\n\r\n<strong>Placement of reinforcement<\/strong>: This is done according to the structural drawing provided\r\n\r\n<strong>Pouring of  concrete<\/strong>: Pouring of workable Concrete and compaction by the use of vibrator.\r\n\r\n<strong>Curing<\/strong>: Curing of the slab for 28days to attain its design strength.\r\n\r\n<strong>Advantages of Solid Slab<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>It is economical for small span<\/li>\r\n \t<li>It is suitable for heavy loads or dynamic load<\/li>\r\n \t<li>It is easy to repair or strengthen<\/li>\r\n \t<li>It is good to hide services such electrical and mechanical pipes.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>Disadvantages of Solid Slab<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>It can be very heavy.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>It is not economical for long span.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Its construction involves much time<\/li>\r\n \t<li>It involves large number of labour work<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>HOLLOW SLAB<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a type of slab that is constructed  with  hollow clay pots or blocks. Hollow clay pot slabs are usually constructed with fewer concrete and reinforcement  compare with solid slab. Hollow blocks are used to fill portions of the slab thickness; this results in deeper the amount of concrete and hence the weight of the slab.\r\n\r\nHollow floors, which floor system in Office buildings, auditori­ums, hotels, commercial buildings, residential dwellings, houses of wor­ship, nursing homes and educational facilities, are all ideal applications. This is because of the advantage it gives in large span and of course its aesthetics cannot be compared to that of the solid slabs.

At times the site may be very quiet and the next day, for instance when there is casting of concrete, a large number of workers turn up and there is a lot activity and the day after, total silence with only the site guard on duty. And if you have no experience in construction, you may not know if the works are on time behind or ahead of schedule.\r\n\r\nTo keep on top of your project, you should ask the main contractor to give you a construction schedule and to make you understand it, request that it is given in bar chart format as in the diagram. As the owner, you do not need details of every aspect of the construction but this bar chart will help you see the bigger picture in an instant. On the left side of the chart is a list of the major construction activities and on top is the time frame (divided in weeks) for carrying out those activities. The chart not only shows when an activity is to be started and completed but also how the activities are inter-related . For instance, the plumber has to put in the drains and some pipes before the german floor of the foundation is cast and if this is not done, the casting date would be affected. In our bar chart, you can see that the plumber visits the site in Week 4 in between Weeks 3 and 5 which is the scheduled period for the foundation and this is for the express purpose of inserting the drains and relevant pipes. If he does not visit, the foundation time frame will be affected. The bar chart also helps you confirm that the necessary off site work, like purchase of materials has been done so that work can go ahead as scheduled. Again from our chart, we can see that electrical works are carried out in weeks 12 and 13 and this is for laying of the conduit pipes and wiring, while the electrician is back again in week 23, this time it will be for fixing lights, light switches etc. if you are not to delay him, you must have made your selection of lights and switches before week 23 and made sure they are on site by that date. For materials that have leadtimes to be delivered, the schedule should alert you to ensure that they have been ordered within a period that will allow for possible delays.\r\n\r\nSo do not go to site as a complete novice.

These are causes with the remedies.<\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n(1) <strong>Improper planning<\/strong>-Before you open up a site it is important you decide on what to do and at what stages tasks will be done so that you don’t end up prolonging some tasks and not doing some until when it will affect other tasks on site. This will cause wastages to arise on a site for example you decide to paint the building before you realise there are some spots that needs to be patched , obviously wherever the repair is done you will still need to paint again which is a loss\/wastage to the project.\r\n(2) <strong>Unskilled labour<\/strong>- one of the fastest ways to lose money on site is using quacks or unskilled labour to do some important tasks, you may have been charged less but at the end you’ll spend more money repairing the work the unskilled labourers did.\r\n(3) <strong>Delayed payments<\/strong>-Delay in payments affects planning and will also affect the cost of labour because more days will be spent completing a project that could have been done in a specified time frame.\r\n(4) <strong>Unscheduled disbursement of funds<\/strong>-Despite that there shouldn’t be delay in payments, releasing money carelessly or without proper account can give your builder\/contractor a false impression there is plenty of money to be made which may cause excesses on his part.\r\n(5) <strong>No schedule of work<\/strong>-There must be a document containing how a project will be carried out, the time allocated to each task and showing how the task will overlap each other and help to achieve a wholesome project.\r\n(6) <strong>Untested Artisans<\/strong>-There is no harm in using different artisans for your projects but tested and trusted hands help in no small measure to reduce waste and saves time since they are already used to the contractor\/builder.\r\n(7) <strong>Inexperienced workforce<\/strong>-This will affect the general outlook of your building yet you’ll spend more repairing badly done jobs.\r\n(8) <strong>Not buying materials in bulk<\/strong>-Buying materials only as at when needed from retailers around will cause you to spend double the amount you ought to use for a project, avoid it if necessary.\r\n(9) <strong>Improper storage<\/strong>-Store should be provided either onsite or buildings nearby, and the store must be secured with locks and keys and if possible a security man to monitor activities. Materials should also be protected from rain and other negative environmental conditions.\r\n(10) <strong>Thef<\/strong>t-When there is no adequate monitoring\/security theft is bound to occur.\r\n(11) <strong>No or improper account<\/strong>-How money is spent, materials coming to site, how is being used and for what purposes need to be put into considerations if not, when is difficult to trace materials abuse by workers is inevitable.\r\n(12) <strong>Overzealousness or ‘too know’<\/strong> <strong>on your part<\/strong>- Your builder will not educate you on what you don’t know since you now claim to know so much.\r\n(13) <strong>Ignorance of basic steps\/stages in construction<\/strong>-Not knowing anything at all even if it has to be through reading from the internet may put you at a greater risk from a contractor that wants to outsmart you, if left alone taking over the site may be difficult and chaos in management of materials is inevitable.\r\n(14) <strong>Check and balances every week<\/strong> is important from material bought, materials supplied, to work done.\r\n(15) <strong>Using substandard materials<\/strong>-Substandard materials will make you loose money rather than gain through repairs that will be caused from those materials.\r\n(16) <strong>Buying materials without specifications<\/strong> or your workers help accompanying you to the market may not be too good, you may end up buying materials not suitable for your project which will invariably leads to waste.\r\n\r\n(17) <strong>Site must be fenced<\/strong> to avoid encroachment, things falling out of site to gutters infront and unwelcomed intruders to site.\r\n(18) <strong>Improper siting during Design and construction<\/strong>-You must decide where the gatehouse, septic\/soakaway tank, gen house and other ancillary buildings must be before construction , if not this will lead to major redesign\/reconstruction which will eventually end up in wastages. For instance it is better to locate your septic\/soakaway tank to fall in line with slope of site and placed at the lowest part of site this makes placements of pipes less strenuous to achieve because your plumber won’t be digging much soil.\r\n(19) <strong>Lack of foresight during demolition<\/strong>-There are sites you have to do some demolitions of old buildings onsite before new construction. For a well-planned site, the rubbles from the demolitions will still be useful.\r\n(20) <strong>Contractual matters should be clear<\/strong> and stated in black and white between the client and contractor to avoid arguments at the tail ends of the project.\r\n(21) <strong>Delay due to human factors<\/strong> like deliberate absence by workers or strike action can cause loss of time and money, which will eventually adds up when prolonged.\r\n(22) <strong>Delay due to environmental factors<\/strong> like rainstorm can affect a construction site which can lead to waste. Imagine if you had mixed cement down for some work only for the rain to affect you during execution of task.(23) <strong>Employ security guards<\/strong> if necessary to avoid thefts.\r\n(24) <strong>When no room for overlapping of task<\/strong> . Artisans should be encouraged to work side by side except for some cases to avoid material and time wastages.\r\n(25) <strong>Weak or bad designs in buildings<\/strong>-Using quacks to design a building for you will definitely make you to pay more and may even lead to total collapse of building.\r\n(26) <strong>No site investigation of site before moving to site<\/strong>-This is one of the major and most important steps to take before embarking on any project. If the place is waterlogged or you question the soil integrity, do a soil test, check how safe the place is for your materials to be brought to site? where will your workers stay? where will they sleep? where is food coming from? and how about toilet? If all these are not planned for, you’ll be surprised at man hours to be wasted by your workers because of these.\r\n\r\n<strong><em><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6340\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Arc.Omion-Emmanuel.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"208\" height=\"244\" \/><\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Arc.

Prior to this innovation, buildings used to have solar panel systems mounted on their roofs or elsewhere and these came with a lot of inconsistencies; including several cases of theft and vandalism but now the solar panels have being built into the roof tiles and sheets so that you simply install over the whole area at once or just a portion depending on your power need (i.e. the power requirements of the building). This way solar energy sufficient enough to power all appliances in a regular home can be harvested on a much larger area overhead.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSolar roofing tiles is designed and installed to compliment the home’s architecture while converting energy from sunlight into electricity. But the roofing sheets\/tiles do not come alone; they normally come with powerwall batteries. These batteries enable excess energy generated during peak periods to be stored during off-peak periods and can be used in conjunction with public power source.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are various types of solar roofs available in the market however the solar shingles roof is more commonly used here; most of which still retain their parent material and are typically glass-coated. The solar shingles also referred to as photovoltaic shingles have the solar panels integrated into the naturally asphaltic parent material giving it a glass surface finish which actually bears the solar cells. It is believed that this combination of asphalt base and glass surface material is good enough to make the solar shingle roof last as long as the life span of the building which is traditionally put at 70 years. Although much is not known about the aesthetic functionality of this type of roof after a long period, it is believed that the primary functions of roofs which is to protect the interior of a building or structure from rain, excess sunlight and other external (overhead) weather conditions will not be jeopardized by this relatively new innovation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn Nigeria, particularly faced with erratic power supply in many towns, villages and cities after many years of intervention in various capacities, the adoption and usage of solar roofs is beginning to take center stage in new building and housing estate developments where green (noiseless, neat and eco-friendly) energy is cherished and preferred over the popular substitute. It may not be wrong to say that most people would prefer this system if it comes affordable.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are lots of good stuffs that don’t come cheap and this roof type, from the poor and middle class perspective at present, is one of them. A square metre of solar roof will cost about twice higher to purchase and install than the regular one of its kind and can generate an average of 0.2kWh. Installing solar roofs on your existing building will require that you remove the old roof to allow for the installation of the new one and that comes at an additional cost but for new constructions, this extra cost does not arise. Considering the abundance of sunlight in the country especially during the typical dry seasons, it has been observed that the amount of solar power needed to completely power a typical average nuclear family living unit can be harvested by the solar roof over the house without the need for additional support until terrible down times. The power generated reaches optimal values depending largely on the roof space, the power rating on each unit of roofing sheet or tile and the angle of inclination. This is a huge plus for users of the technology. The cost effectiveness of the system over a period of time therefore is good.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSolar roofs are installed in the same way as the regular roof types except that due to the electrical configurations, the service of an electrical engineer or solar expert is advised. There are some buildings in Nigeria with solar roofs already installed over them and its turning into the next big thing for luxury living. Before buying a solar roof it is important to check for its power rating so that you get value for your money.\r\n\r\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6381\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/This-happens-when-your-structure-is-overloaded-3-1-284x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"188\" height=\"199\" \/><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Engr.

They litter the skyline. They have become so notable and symbolic in some areas that those places are jokingly referred to as ‘Brown Roof Republic’. Everything and Everybody ages, we only manage to keep them evergreen; that’s where the beauty really lies. Roofs are designed to last at least half the life span of a building but they don’t always maintain the same aesthetic value and relative strength throughout this period as it was when they were first installed coupled with the number of inferior roofing products flooding our markets that don’t even stay up to 10 years before failing. There is nothing abnormal with the natural aging process though. The metal roofs rust, stone-coated roofs fade off, asbestos roofs crack, plastic roofs rupture and glass roofs become stricken. They all grow weaker each passing year from external weather conditions and bow to wind pressures at some point. But when there is a will to restore them, there is always a way!\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nRoofs installed on top of a building are normally put in place to protect the interior and some part of the exterior of the building from the direct effect of sunlight, rainfall and other external weather conditions. This no doubt makes the roof a very vital component of the building. Remove the roof from your house; then you no longer have a house but an ‘open arcade’ where the kids can have fun when the weather is just cool. Generally in building construction, roofs, except concrete roof and similar types consist not only of the roof covering but also the carcass. In Nigeria and elsewhere, the carcass and roof covering material usually constitute more than 10% of the entire construction cost for bungalows but lesser as the building rises and this is evident in the fact they often spread beyond the perimeter of the building with clearance of 600mm or more away from the face of the building on nearly all sides, depending on the design. The roof carcass are made of tie beams, trusses, struts, purlins, king post, queen post and so on connected together to form a rigid frame to support the roof covering (roofing sheets or tiles or other materials) usually installed directly over them; although this is not often the case for concrete roofs which are normally reinforced internally with metal rebars, bamboo strands, etc or externally with thick anti-rust metal plates.\r\n\r\nBeyond this description, roofs have become key aesthetic components of buildings for which architects can play in designs. By manipulating the design of a roof you can actually give a unique perspective to a building. A lot of people are familiar with various roofing styles but not much is known about what to do when the roof loses its value. ‘Replacement’ readily comes to mind. However, you can actually strengthen and restore your roof completely without necessarily removing any piece. For concrete roofs you simply strengthen the concrete and damp-proof membrane. For roofing sheets and tiles, you clean up dust and dirt from the surface using anti-grease or sugar soap and a wire brush or large sand-paper brush for metal roof and a soft brush or sander for stone-coated tiles. After cleaning the entire surfaces of grime, loose paints and dirt, steam-spray the roof or simply flush with warm water over it to rinse off. Give it some time to dry. Then spray a recommended strengthening mix over the surface to improve its strength. The strengthening mix defer with various roof types. Find out the one that is suitable for your roof. Some re-coating paints naturally come with such mix. Leave it for a while to set too. Thereafter you spray the surface with rust-inhibiting primer and then followed immediately after by acrylic latex paint or other suitable equivalents of your new choice of colour in two coats. Use brushes to apply to edges or smaller areas. Roof restoration can keep your roof in good shape for additional 30 years. This is how to make your old roof new at reduced cost (some 62% lower than the cost of replacement) in few hours and you leave everyone thinking their eyes must have been deceiving them!\r\n\r\n<em><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6461\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/This-happens-when-your-structure-is-overloaded-3-2-284x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"182\" height=\"192\" \/><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>Engr.

Planks are in length of 3.6m or 12ft, since the facial is placed round the perimeter of the building, calculate the perimeter, multiply by 3 ,then divide by 3.6m or 12 feet to get the total numbers of planks of 1by12 you will need to order for in the market. ( You need planks as base for the extended portion of the concrete facial, some planks will be cut to sizes as shown in pictures to form the external surface portion which is mostly in curves.\r\n\r\nPlywood will have to be laid along the external surface as shown in pictures to give a smooth finish to the concrete externally. The shape of the external surface is determined by your design so your design will show how you will cut the plan that will form and support the external surface, just as earlier said the curved edge can be replaced with any design you wish to have which will also makes it unique.\r\n\r\nThe best approach in constructing concrete facial is as explained  further down page .\r\n\r\nLeave one coach of blockwork to accommodate a beam which also serves as the roof beam, this traditional roof beam is now added an extension of 8mm rods jotting out from each ring of the reinforcements\/iron rods.

A textured finish may also be used to decorate the concrete.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How is it properly done?<\/strong>\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nThe installation requires the right tools, materials (in the recommended ratios), expertise and favourable jobsite conditions to ensure a successful outcome.\r\n\r\nSpecialized equipment is needed to stamp the desired pattern onto the concrete before it dries out. The technicalities of pouring out the concrete onto the installation areas are also a challenge. Overall It is a laborious and time-sensitive process although the finished look is well worth the effort.\r\n\r\nGood planning and fore-preparation are necessary to make sure everything comes out as designed.\r\n\r\nA well-compacted sub-grade is critical to the structural integrity of the concrete slab as it helps drainage and can prevent soil erosion under the concrete.\r\n\r\nInstallation of proper Control Joints which must be cut to a depth of at least one quarter of the slab thickness are required to prevent and control cracking. It is critical to use a Mixer for smooth and consistent \"bubbles-free\" concrete mix that can stand up to the anticipated exposure conditions such as wear and tear from foot or vehicle traffic. Special attention must also be paid to the water-cement ratio, to get the right cement paste for durability. Cement grade of 42.5 is recommended for external floors. .For many slabs, reinforcement in the form of steel bars, welded wire mesh or fibre is necessary to augment strength and control cracking. This is especially critical for drive-ways and other surfaces that will support vehicle or heavy traffic.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Common Pitfalls<\/strong>\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the pitfalls to avoid;\r\n\r\n<strong>Wrong Concrete Paste and Hand-Mixing<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNot any proportion of concrete mixtures can be used. As ready mix is not readily available to small and medium sized constructions in Nigeria, its best to go with the mixer, because hand mixing will always have defects especially when the Labour crewmembers begin to tire out. Concrete must be allowed to cure (i.e. dry) properly (needs 3 clear days without rain) before washing and sealing it.\r\n\r\nUnrealistic Colours and Poor Finish An illusion of natural Colour can only seem realistic if the Colours are realistic and in harmony with the environment and creates the desired effect. It is best to consult the experts when choosing colours. The quality of Finish is highly dependent on the quality of Colour Hardners and Antiquing Release Powders. These are mainly imported and there are very few suppliers in the market. It is critical to ensure these materials are not diluted with locally mixed pigments and white cement (a common practice amongst installers) as it will ultimately impact on the quality of the finish and the longevity of the installation. For this purpose it’s best to buyer materials directly from the Suppliers as the least Quality control Effort by project owner towards the Output.\r\n\r\n<strong>Non-Sealing and Lack of Maintenance<\/strong>\r\n\r\nStamped concrete has to be sealed properly for it to preserve the colours as well as the texture. This\r\n\r\nalso prevents the concrete from getting discolored by molds, stains, algae and other contaminants.\r\n\r\n<strong>Inadequate Tools and Poor Supervision:<\/strong>\r\n\r\nLike any service and technical work, the quality of the final output is highly dependent on the tools,\r\n\r\nexperience, dedication and quality of supervision, more so in construction work. Paying attention to the finer details is highly necessary to produce quality work. Very few Installers use the correct and\r\n\r\nrecommended tools and understandably this impacts on the quality of work output.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mixing Products of Different Brands:<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAnother common practice of Installers is to combine stamped concrete materials of different brands forgetting that the Chemical components of these products are designed as an integrated system to achieve a desired result. For example some buy Colour Hardners of particular brand and use Antiquing Release Powder of another brand. It is critical to ensure materials of the same brands are combined at all times.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"A –Z of getting a stamped concrete driveway.","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"a-z-of-getting-a-stamped-concrete-driveway","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:48:40","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:48:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=6558","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The general concept is to keep the air moving.\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Providing a shade porch-A porch will help break the sunrays and reduce its penetration into the interior.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Choose sites and orient your house to take advantage of the naturally occurring wind flow. That is more openings should be along the inward and leeward side of the wind.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>You can make your windows tall on opposite sides of the room to give good cross ventilation.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>You can also create a smaller opening directly up on top of the normal bigger ones in the room-This is called “stack effect” whereby hot air generated from the ground naturally moves up to be replaced by cooler air from the top this will make the air circulate better and will also reduce the temperature as new and fresh air enters from the smaller top windows into the room and replaces the hot ones closer to the ground.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>High walls also help to reduce temperature, that’s why most buildings with high volume of traffic are always very high-mosque ,church , halls etc. The same principle of hot air navigating and finding ways of escape from the building through several vents and other channels.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Minimize the numbers of windows facing East and West or totally avoid it if possible to avoid sunrays of rising Eastern sun in the morning and intense western setting sun in the evenings<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Provide properly sized overhangs for your  windows and doors will also help in reducing heat in the home.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Use of very thick solid walls to slowly absorb heat during the day and slowly releases the heat out at night. Imagine the cooling effect you experience when you enter a cave and mud houses.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Also thick blocks with wide hollow space can help reduce heat-When the sunrays  heat the first portion of the block during transmission of the heat the hollow space help to break direct transmission to the exterior, meanwhile remember the hotter air will always find its way up to give room to the cooler air to come down (note: when you boil your water)<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Since sun rises from the east and sets in the west, you can easily minimize the wall space facing these sides and increase the wall space facing North and South especially when you are not limited by space.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Use light coloured roof-Light colour reflects, and makes the roof reflective .<\/li>\r\n \t<li> In the design of the building you can have exterior walls as part of the building but  jutting out to effectively block some sunrays. This could be fins along the windows.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Louvered interior doors will make air flow without inhibitions in the interior<\/li>\r\n \t<li>In design if block walls in the interior can be reduced to create room for  open space for air to pass.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Use of dwarf walls in the interior where necessary is also an advantage<\/li>\r\n \t<li>You can also have openings at the top of doors for air to easily flow even through the rooms in the interior<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Usage of reflective windows-You can ask specifically for reflective windows from your builder. Reflective windows reflects some percentage of the sunray thereby reducing heat in the home.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>You can also help yourself by minimizing heat generated indoors through your appliances- Select energy efficient appliances , for example energy saving bulbs will reduce heat in your home to the conventional type.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>By your actions too you can reduce the level of heat generated indoors by simply scheduling the use of your kitchen and laundry appliances in the cooler mornings and night.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Of course plant gardens in your home.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>The paint colour of your wall will reflect some percentage of sunray when is light. Make your wall colour a light one<\/li>\r\n \t<li>When you have  roof vents, gable vents etc in your building, the heat generated inwards will have a wider means of escaping and the cooler air too can be drawn inside.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Make your plastering smooth, it will reflect better to rough plaster.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<strong>Construction “air conditioners” for the home<\/strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_6598\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"567\"]<img class=\" wp-image-6598\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/How-to-cool-your-Home-or-Building-naturally-2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"567\" height=\"425\" \/> Shutters[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_6602\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"567\"]<img class=\" wp-image-6602\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/How-to-cool-your-Home-or-Building-naturally-3-300x295.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"567\" height=\"557\" \/> Awning[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>","post_title":"How to cool your Home or Building naturally","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"how-to-cool-your-home-or-building-naturally","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:48:50","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:48:50","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=6581","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Whether it’s due to cost considerations or environmental factors, exploring alternatives is highly welcomed. Being the world’s most commonly used building material, nearly all our buildings have a signature of concrete on them. Unfortunately, the cost of a cubic-metre of concrete produced in Nigeria has nearly doubled in recent times. The price of iron rods (or steel rebars) is also largely unstable; swinging here and there like a triggered pendulum. There seem to be absence of any serious price regulation mechanism and the manufacturers also have their own side to the story – exchange rate issues, increased cost of raw materials, taxation and all sorts. It is not clear whether the building industry has any special provision for the average person or the common man. Interests charged on financial loans are not encouraging. You can go on and on; but complaining is obviously not the solution. They say if life gives you lemons, make lemonades out of it. Here we are; we need to reinforce concrete to maximize its potential and we have got an option –bamboo.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nTested, tried and trusted, bamboo has appreciable tensile and compressive strengths making it suitable for use as reinforcement in concrete. With ultimate tensile strength reaching 124N\/sqMM, it only takes a combination of bamboo strands to equal the 250N\/sqMM ultimate tensile strength of mild steel and 460N\/sqMM  tensile strength of high-yield steel rebars in common use today. More so, provision for bamboo reinforcement in concrete is structurally designed in the same way as steel rebars; the mix ratios and construction processes for bamboo in concrete are not different from the norm, making it not necessarily a change in technology but a change in the material used. It’s that simple! There are around 15,000 species of bamboos around the world; the suitable variants are abundant and wasting away in our mangrove forests and elsewhere while we simply look away. There is need to put on a thinking cap and intensify research on the use of the naturally-occurring bamboo which is bio-degradable and eco-friendly than the carbonized steel rods. However just like every other construction material, bamboo has its own limitations; perhaps that is why it has not been approved for use in fully load-bearing members. Does this mean it can’t be used for concrete at all? No!\r\n\r\nBamboos, like several other plants when placed in water tend to absorb it and swell. As it expands in the concrete, it makes the concrete to crack. Water is needed to work concrete and there lies an issue. Researchers have provided solution to curing bamboo to be used in concrete so that it does not absorb water as much as it would normally do.  This treatment can be done right on the site or through other industrial processes before taking the bamboo strands to site. You have to be sure to select healthy brown ones with sizable culms to reduce the cost of treatment. Another worrisome issue was the bonding potential. Naturally bamboo has a smooth surface so it may not bond properly with cement, sand and granite or other aggregates in the mix therefore the strands are often chopped in various sections along its length before they are used in concrete. Beyond these two prevailing limitations, what bothers users is the durability of the material in concrete; that’s why it’s not yet broadly applicable for use in fully load-bearing members. As it stands now, the improved variety can be comfortably used for concrete piers, coping and panel of fence walls, lintel beams, ground floor slabs (or ‘German’ floors) in areas with low water table, construction of concrete kerbs, dividers, entrance pavements, wholly in concrete in temporary structures, roof parapets, ground decks, in the construction of low traffic concrete roads and as composite placed side by side with iron rods. Using bamboo as reinforcement slashes the cumulative cost of producing reinforced concrete by almost half. There are no known producers of the improved variety of this material in the country and this also poses an investment opportunity to investors interested in alternative building materials and technology.\r\n\r\n<strong><em><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6756\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/This-happens-when-your-structure-is-overloaded-3-3-284x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"162\" height=\"171\" \/><\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Engr.

If you are careless the probability of having cracked walls will be high.\r\nThese amongst others are the causes and how to avoid them-\r\n(1)Wrong block moulding mixture-Cement and sand mixture for sand needs to be properly checked which is usually between 1:6 to 1:8 depends on types of constituents.\r\nVery good mixture for a 9” block will produce 30 pieces worst it should not exceed 50 on any account.\r\nStone dust are also added in a proportion to give a stronger block, trying to save cost by using inadequate cement, sand ratio will weaken your walls and can lead to cracks.\r\n(2)Wrong cement mortar mixture-Mortar is what you use as the bond between one block and the other, the blocks are expected to be adequately bonded by the mortar, if this is weak it can also affect the block and can lead to cracking.\r\n(3)Wrong laying pattern-Blocks should be set on each other in herringbone manner see diagram.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6786\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Causes-and-How-to-avoid-cracks-when-laying-blocks.-2-300x229.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"647\" height=\"494\" \/>[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nLaying the edge of one block on another causes cracking along the mortar line when is not broken by locking it up with other blocks, The vertical mortar line is the weakest point and should be broken by walls, straight line from top to bottom will cause cracking.\r\n(4)Weak Foundation- Weak foundation causes unusual settlements and movements on foundation that will ultimately affects the blockwalls on top, this surely will cause cracks from foundation through the walls . Cracks could be horizontal or vertical, the horizontal requires serious structural remedy because that may be due to uneven settlements.\r\n(5) P’lumbness’ or straightness when laying your blocks can also adversely affect the blockwork especially when is terribly done.\r\n(6)Boring holes indiscriminately-Electricians and plumbers are major culprits on site when it involves creating holes on block walls. Caution needs to be taken when creating these holes for  scaffolding otherwise you will have crack walls or you can go for total free standing scaffolds.\r\n(7)Long, successive horizontal and vertical blockworks without concrete breaks- laying blocks on each other with any height beyond 3.6m without a corresponding concrete break will create pressure on blockwalls which can also cause cracking especially when the blocks are not strong and loadbearing.\r\n(8)Wet blocks-Blocks are supposed to be left to dry and strong before usage, usually it takes minimum of 48 hours to cure, using blocks under 24 hours is not advisable and it leads to cracking.\r\n(9) Mishandling of blocks-Proper care should be taken when blocks are in use.\r\n(10 )Impurities in mixture-When there are impurities in constituents  that make up the block, expect a weak output which will surely leads to cracking.\r\n(11) Improper or wrong materials will not help save money but will create problems: for instance using sand gathered from drainage gutter.\r\n(12) Loosely compacted blocks during moulding will also affect the block, which will lead to cracking.\r\n(13) Inadequate concrete support incase of load.\r\n(14) Shrinkage-When you build on a clay soil that contracts and expands. Clay causes movement in foundation and when the foundation is shallow it will affect the blockwall.\r\n(15) Using fresh blocks\r\n(16) Using unclean sand with clay just as stated in ‘14’ above,clay contracts when is dried and expands when it is wet: these movements causes cracking.\r\n(17) Flooding-Areas susceptible to long-term flooding will also experience walls cracking. Water can go underneath foundation, weaken the foundation and cause movements, which will affect the blockwalls and leads to cracking.\r\n(18) Differential settlements in foundation-Please check to make sure where you are building, the problem of differential settlements does not arise.\r\n(19) Unevenly compacted fill. When you fill the foundation with laterite but you didn’t ‘rammer’ or compact very well the areas with loose soil will affect the blockwall on top of it and cause cracks.\r\n(20) When one side settles on rock which can’t have any further settlement with a corresponding soil area that is required to settle, expect cracking of walls especially when the block spans across.\r\n(21) Poorly designed structure without adequate planning of walls joining each other.\r\n(22) When you have extremely rich mortar mix, this will also affect block and make it to crack, especially when you want to remove and place elsewhere. It causes wall stiffness; there should be room for the wall to breathe.\r\n(23) Rapid loading of blockworks-When you have a deadline and you put too many blocks on each other you are most likely to have cracks.\r\n(24) Removing props or construction supports too early will create tension on the blockwall which can lead to cracks\r\n(25) When you have deciduous trees with roots growing underneath the foundation.\r\n(26) Free standing walls-This is caused by bad designs when you have too many walls not locking with other walls. The isolated walls are likely to crack.\r\n(27) Rising damp around building.\r\n(28) Poor drainage will make water gather around building which will ultimately affect the walls.\r\n(29) Mining activities around building will cause vibration and affects the wall which can cause cracking especially when it involves blasting of rocks etc with explosives.\r\n(30) Very short lintel (concrete) ontop of windows, doors and other openings will affect the surrounding blocks and cause cracks.\r\n(32)  No oversite concrete or german floor.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Causes and How to avoid cracks when laying blocks.","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"causes-and-how-to-avoid-cracks-when-laying-blocks-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:48:16","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:48:16","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=6761","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Engr <\/em><\/strong><strong><em>Osaz. J. ENOBAKHARE gives advice on how you can ensure your project can be finished close to your budget and wallet!<\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe two major cost models relative to the project design are; Cost to design (CTD) and Design to Cost (DTC). Cost to design simply means putting up a design first and then estimating the total construction cost from the design usually without formally tying it to any budget while Design to cost entails stating your budget for the project first, then ensuring that the project is designed to be completed within that budget. For instance using the recommended DTC model, a project owner can approach a designer\/contractor with say 4 Million Naira to construct a simple bungalow and achieve his\/her desires within it in the following simple steps;\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>First, you discuss the development idea\/concept with the designer\/contractor,<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Thereafter you reveal your initial budget, say 3.5 Million Naira and retain the balance,<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Then request that the designer\/contractor provide two or three design options that can be achieved within your budget and based on your specifications (e.g. It should consist of 3 beds -all rooms en-suite, French-style windows, an ante-room, slanting height, a court yard etc). However it is strongly recommended that you employ the service of a designer\/contractor with good knowledge of both design, estimation and construction from the start as it is in common knowledge that most independent designers\/architects aren’t good estimators or alternatively you co-engage a Quantity Surveyor to achieve your cost goal (You will have to pay for this service say around 5% of the total project cost).<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Once the preliminary site investigation is completed and the building designs and cost estimates are ready, you then choose the most appealing design. Do not hesitate to pre-inform the estimator\/contractor to simplify the cost estimates by breaking it into two main sections one showing the Material cost\/schedule and the other, the labour cost\/schedule (which will include the contractor’s profit so that it can be negotiated separately). You have to study the estimates carefully and compare for consistency with the design.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Because some features would have been deliberately excluded in the design in order to make it fit into the cost plan, you may have to add some much desired features (like special finishes, fittings and fixtures, etc) within your initial retention budget (in this case, the 500,000 NGN left). But don’t use all of it; keep a fraction for contingencies, and<\/li>\r\n \t<li>You are good to go.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nHowever in the Cost-to-Design model, the project owner\/landlord is highly disadvantaged in that the designer\/contractor may come up with fabulous designs that may be far beyond your budget because there have been little or no consideration of the cost implication of the design at the initial stage.  This is the most common case in practice. When this happens, subsequently the project owner lured to this expensive design begins to run helter-skelter to source for additional funds to complete the project and this is not usually a funny experience.\r\n\r\nThink carefully and make the right choice of cost model to adopt for your next building project.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6807\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Building-in-a-recession-how-to-get-a-design-you-can-afford-to-build-300x202.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"607\" height=\"409\" \/>\r\n\r\nEngr.

Some fences are simply symbolic while others are basically for defense. They also help to prevent land encroachment from neighbors which is not uncommon in this clime. However, fences can be designed to perform yet another critical function of flood control especially for buildings constructed in areas prone to flash floods, run-off waters from faulty drains, erosion, etc. This is the core functions of embankments and retaining walls including the ability to stay earth. Retaining walls hold back or fend off flood waters from entering into your compound. There are a number of designs and technologies suited for this purpose and they can be incorporated into your fence wall and not necessarily constructed separately; saving cost and space in the end.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nGenerally, aesthetics is valued from outside in, not necessarily inside out. Therefore the perimeter fence and gate of our houses becomes a very vital point for aesthetic reference for the buildings as a whole, being mostly the first point of contact. This places a burden on the designer (or architect) to allow for aesthetic considerations for perimeter fences intended to serve as retaining walls or embankments; understanding that these fence types will be under intense water pressure when the weather goes wild compared to ordinary fences. Only suitable color, texture and styles should be used for the finishes of such fence walls. Stone-based finishes are often recommended while some others prefer to use special moisture-resistant paints and coverings. There is also the structural engineering consideration which factors in the strength, stability and durability components. If the fence is beautiful but cannot stand strong against flood pressure adequately, then it may be considered good for nothing. The method of building them is slightly different from the normal ones. One striking difference is that the base for retaining walls are normally higher than those of other fence types usually extending beyond the level of projected flood heights before block walls are introduced. Some are even designed to be trapezoidal rather than rectangular in section.\r\n\r\nPerimeter fences are normally designed either as non-load-bearing or partially-load-bearing walls but those intended for retaining walls are essentially load-bearing walls. They do not support their weights alone or small loads from security furniture but also sizable pressure forces from external flood. There are various types of materials that can be used for building special fences of this nature; the most common type is concrete. Other types include a composite of reinforced stabilized earth with bricks or blocks as well as other poly-based substitutes for concrete. Whichever material is used, there is need for it to possess sufficient strength to withstand the pressure forces of water as well as be stable enough not to deflect, crack, fail or over-settle in the process. It should also be able to perform this function throughout the life span of the building or space it was designed to serve.\r\n\r\nIn areas susceptible to flood, the sub-surface soil conditions are often poor because of the long overbearing effect of stayed water on them, so there is always a need to take cognizance of the nature of the soil during the design of the fence. Well-built solid raft base or a combination of short-bored piles and reinforced concrete strip are good options for the foundation of such walls. Reinforced stabilized earth has also been successfully used for this purpose and is said to be a cheaper option to both polymer-based fences and concrete.\r\n\r\nFlood control is serious business especially in rainy seasons. There is no better way to imagine the devastating effect of flood than to watch a house go partially or completely under water; destroying the building fabric and other valuable properties in the process. Although fencing alone cannot completely take care of flood on a large scale however it is known fact that the retaining wall fence type surely minimizes the effect by helping to redirect water from a property.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6756\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/This-happens-when-your-structure-is-overloaded-3-3-284x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"284\" height=\"300\" \/><\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Engr.

During this wet season, some uninformed project owners abandon their on-going projects or delay the commencement of new ones even when the funds are readily available citing a myriad of reasons why such works should be postponed till the dry season sets in. Sometimes it is the contractors, who should know best that even concoct lame excuses to provoke the halting of such projects, probably to satisfy their own selfish interest –like buying enough time to embark on their personal or similar project(s) elsewhere, creating time to embark on travels and tours and so on.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nYes, rain can wash off freshly-applied paints on external walls. It can also affect the process of block setting in block walls and erode cement in concrete\/mortar and cause all sorts of mess. The reality remains that the wise ones know the season could equally be a blessing in disguise; from economic advantage to a spot-on opportunity to probe if there are leakages within the structure under construction or whether it can withstand harsh external weather condition as well as provide good resistance to moisture\/water penetration from surface and underground sources.\r\n\r\nIt might be quite difficult in some cases to ascertain how a building constructed on a water-logged land for example, would function against flooding or rise in water levels if it was built during the dry season especially when you are not fully abreast of the climatic or environmental history of the area. However, building in the rains would make it easier to observe first-hand what the situation is like. This would make both the constructor and the owner make more informed decision on better route and depth for waste water channeling, establishing minimum ground floor level in relation to the road and adjoining buildings and\/or facilities, etc. such seasons aren’t the best times for inexperienced contractors because there is the tendency that their weaknesses would be exposed to their clients, which may cause them to lose the project. Likewise some property marketers or estate agents decline requests for property inspection from prospective clients during the wet period for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nIt is also common knowledge that owing to low patronage typical of the season, prices of building materials in the local market, especially cement, paint, fittings, fixtures, etc are generally lower. The same goes for the cost of labour. Experience has therefore shown that building in the rains, if carefully executed using the right methods and processes is highly rewarding especially for the project owner.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Building in the Rains can be very Rewarding","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"building-in-the-rains-can-be-very-rewarding","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:48:10","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:48:10","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=6880","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

During Q4:2016, the construction sector contracted -6.03%.\r\n\r\nIn a speech delivered earlier this month by Osinbajo on Buhari’s economic plan, he assured Nigerians that “there is light at the end of the tunnel”. Osinbajo explained that the Government and CBN are working on replacing the 41 items not valid for foreign exchange with a more trade policy-driven restrictions, taking into account those items that are required and locally unavailable raw materials. This comes in line with their focus on aligning fiscal with monetary policy and nudging the CBN towards the objective of more market determined exchange rates that led to the introduction of the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate (NAFEX).\r\n\r\nDolapo Omidire\r\n\r\n<strong>estate intel<\/strong>\r\n\r\nwww.estateintel.com\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Will ‘banned’ construction materials get a reprieve?","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"will-banned-construction-materials-get-a-reprieve","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:37:29","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:37:29","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=7051","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

That’s a safe bet but it could be extremely boring.  Fenestration is defined as the design and disposition of windows and other exterior openings of a building.\r\n\r\nThe façade of this home, located in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roosendaal\">Roosendaal<\/a> , The Netherlands, has been rescued from ordinariness by the varying sizes and shapes of the windows. In particular, the window that protrudes out from the house, making it large enough to have a deep window seat for someone to sit in, is a ‘double take’ feature and it has a very practical use as well.\r\n\r\nThe typical response by architects in these parts to add some pizzazz to building facades is to attach facing bricks in some form of design, a practice which is getting dated and is more likely to ruin the looks of a building than enhance it. The creative placement of window and other openings can achieve the effect better, much better.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Fenestration: the arrangement of windows and other openings on a building.<\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\nArchitecture by <strong>Dutch design office <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zonezuid.nl\">zone zuid architecten<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>","post_title":"The ‘eyes’ of the building…..","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"the-eyes-of-the-building-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:37:01","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:37:01","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=7310","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

In some up market developments, the cost of the kitchen is much more than for the bedroom or even the living room. Kitchen designers keep pushing the boundary and some have introduced colour as a major differentiator to keep their designs unique and fresh. We` agree that the use of colour, especially in small kitchen is to be welcomed but in our view, it shouldn’t be overwhelming. So how do you introduce that right amount of colour in your kitchen?Here are some examples…….\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7672\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/A-hint-of-colour-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"769\" height=\"428\" \/>[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nThe use of coloured splash-backs  is one way designers have introduced colour into a kitchen scheme. In this design, the splashback is, not only, at the cooker area up to the extractor but runs around the kitchen and is a backdrop for the electrical fittings.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7700\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/2-6-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"493\" \/>\r\n\r\nHere colour is used more elaborately but the main point of focus – the worktop, lower cabinets, breakfast bar are white. With the upper cabinets and ground to floor cabinets on the left in vibrant colour, the kitchen is more interesting and vibrant instead of the sterility, an all white kitchen would have had.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7701\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/3-4-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"738\" height=\"738\" \/>\r\n\r\nDark cabinets, dark worktop and dark splashback.  This kitchen has been lifted by the introduction of elements of yellow in the breakfast bar and as a background for exposed shelves.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7704\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/4-5-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"737\" height=\"983\" \/>\r\n\r\nDark cabinets, dark floors and a white counter top. A serious kitchen. Maybe too serious. Three wall cabinets in dazzling orange should add some zest. And it does.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7710\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/5n-1-216x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"731\" height=\"1016\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhy use one colour when you can use two?

However, once in a while we are drawn away from this practical mode by architecture that blows you away. The  Kloof Road House, an extension completed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nicovdmeulen.com\">Nico van der Meulen Architects<\/a> in Bedfordview, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homedsgn.com\/tag\/johannesburg\/\">Johannesburg<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homedsgn.com\/tag\/south-africa\/\">South Africa<\/a> is one such example.\r\n\r\nBut is it architecture or a work of art……like a well worked sculpture? This is how <a href=\"http:\/\/www.architonic.com\">www.architonic.com<\/a> describes the façade : “Werner van der Meulen used morphed steels forms that wrap around and frame the structure by the use of parasitic architecture. From the street, the boldly designed off-shutter boundary wall with black steel shapes creeping over predicts that this is no ordinary piece of architecture.\r\n\r\nThe black steel sliding garage doors of the four new garages that were added on top of the existing house, combine with the sculptural steel forms of the guard house and porte cochere. Diagonal strip lights featured within the wall of the entrance create an abstract pattern at night that guides visitors to the entrance gate.\r\n\r\nSteel, glass and concrete are prominently used in Kloof Road House and have been integrated into the design, from the boundary wall all the way to the interior. The angled steel roof of the entrance hall overhangs the double volume window and glass front door at the entrance, while the sculptural steel staircase is visible behind the window. The wall of the entrance is clad with natural timber in a herringbone pattern to soften the harshness of the steel, glass and concrete interior, while the backlit ceilings create a shadowless interior inside the sculptured 3D forms. “\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>","post_title":"Architecture or sculpture?","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"architecture-or-sculpture","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:30:25","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:30:25","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=7729","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Martin Friedrich Architects was commissioned to renovate it and they have fused curves into what used to be a building of straight lines. A 2 storey curved section made from concrete was used to create a dramatic and striking façade. This section frames the existing outline of the building and gives projection for the balcony and entry canopy below. To add texture,  double storey full height glazing and a 2-storey band of black Japanese oak  was incorporated. These contrasting elements enhance rather than detract from the minimalist white render exterior and at the same time make the appearance less stark.The language of the curved section was carried on to the back of the building and outhouses like the pool house creating the same dramatic effect.<\/h4>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7909\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/1-6-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"1092\" \/><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7911\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/2-9-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"716\" height=\"954\" \/><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7912\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/3-7-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"716\" height=\"1074\" \/><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7915\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/4-8-153x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"717\" height=\"1406\" \/><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7918\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Untitled-6-copy-300x129.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"719\" height=\"309\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>","post_title":"When the curve meets the straight line","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"when-the-curve-meets-the-straight-line","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:29:59","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:29:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=7882","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

And you will be correct if you view the space as one designated for sleeping. But it can be much more than that. It can be transformed into a romantic getaway within a home. A magical space for couples and even singles.\r\n\r\nThe key to this is lighting. In the bedroom, think less of the beauty of the light brackets and more of the kind of light they project. You need different kind of light sources – direct light for reading, projected light to illuminate specific areas – like a beloved painting or photograph, and then look for softer, diffused light sources that can create a scene from Arabian Nights , in your room. Ensure that the lights come with dimmer switches, so you can control the amount of light at any time. Coloured bulbs? If tasteful, why not indeed. Lamps, recessed lighting etc, think outside the box to create an extraordinary space. With all the stress in Nigeria, you need to keep the recession angst outside your budoir and make it a place to recharge your batteries.

The downward correction of rental rates in the greater Lagos Island market has been tough for landlords. Buildings which had previously demanded rentals of US$1,000m2 are closer to US$650m2. It is telling that new, quality supply to the market, can still attain rents in the region of US$800-850m2. <\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>There has been equal pressure on the retail space as well of course. Currency pressures, high infation rates and an overall slowdown in economic activity in the country has combined with oversupply to create a challenging environment. Retail centres in Lagos have witnessed declining footfalls in the larger shopping centres, which has translated into reduced demand for large-sized retail outlets. This has le high vacancies in some shopping centres. <\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>In this context, market penetration for international brands has proven particularly di icult. Last year, fashion chain, Truworths pulled out of the market siting high rentals and import restrictions.

Recessed lighting fixtures can be used to display art in particular sections of your home. One could install them exactly over that area to give a spotlight in a part of the room. You can also install soft lighting over the art that hang on your walls. It is advisable to ask you architect \/ interior designer for the most appropriate type of bulbs to use here so hat the art will not get damaged by the heat emanating from the bulb. You are able to change the appearance of your display whenever you want by attaching your display area lights in switches of dimmer. Another way to go would be to add a twist to it by creating an unusual display. For instance in the display area of your sitting room, coloured light bulbs could be included in the lighting fixtures in line with the design of the pop ceiling.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8388\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/3-13-300x193.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"766\" height=\"493\" \/><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8389\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/4-12-300x222.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"568\" \/><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8391\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/5-6-300x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"763\" height=\"636\" \/><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8392\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/6-3-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"761\" height=\"571\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8397\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Lights-POP-Ceiling…….action-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"759\" height=\"569\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>","post_title":"Lights, POP Ceiling…….action!","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"lights-pop-ceiling-action","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:21:59","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:21:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=8362","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

As we stepped into the first storey show flat from the lobby which was still in raw concrete form, we could see that 4 Bourdillon was going to exceed all standards for luxury and possibly set a new marker.\r\n\r\nThe Living room space is a large expanse of open plan beauty which is accentuated by the floor to ceiling glass sliding doors which take one entire 'wall' of the room. Note that the ceiling to floor height is 3 metres – and it shows!

We also love space-creating ideas. When both come together, we are over the moon. This wall organiser by Danish brand, <em>Ferm Living<\/em>, is an example of the fusion of space saving and space creation.\r\n\r\nA desk in the corner of a room does not a study make. However, combine the desk with the <em>Ferm Living<\/em> Wall organiser and a genuine home office space has been created.\r\n\r\nBecause the organiser is hung on the wall, it does not take up valuable floor space, especially important in small apartments. The various ledges, hanging pegs and pigeon holes are artistically arranged to give a sculptural aura to the piece. We especially like the slatted backboard, which gives texture to the piece. However, it is utilitarian- a working furniture piece that stores various items required for home office use.\r\n\r\nIf you gave a small apartment or you want to create a study area for a young child, this is a great idea to implement as you can create a bespoke version depending on the user and space available.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>","post_title":"An instant study","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"an-instant-study","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:17:28","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:17:28","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=8571","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The R House immediately captures the imagination because although it ids a townhouse design, all the units are, for lack of a better word ‘self-contained. For example, communal parking, which is standard for many townhouse complexes has been eradicated by incorporating a garage at the ground floor of each unit. And it is not the ‘open air’ type of garage where the occupant has no privacy but one, which can be sealed off, which means that it is a space that can be used for storage and utilities.\r\n\r\nThen there are the fins, which segregate the upper floors. This means that those enjoying the terraces on the upper floors and the garden on the first floor can do so, without having to ‘greet’ their neighbours!\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nThe R-House compound is composed of 6 individual single-family houses which are arranged in a linear relationship on a rectilinear plot. The program calls for a parking garage, a living room, a kitchen with dining room, two master bedrooms, two regular bedrooms and a study room. It was apparent for us to create a housing typology which would describe the intimate relationship of car and human for a residential compound like this located at the outskirt of Tainan City center.\r\n\r\nWe started off by creating two boxes, one being the garage and the other being the living space itself, and tried to dissolve these two volumes into once continuous space by juxtaposing them side by side with a gap that allows for natural light to penetrate through. By doing so, we were able to blur the boundary of inside and outside, and was able to establish the co-existence of garage and the living room all at once with no apparent hierarchy. We then lifted all the bedrooms to the second floor and above for\r\n\r\nnicer views and better natural ventilation.

The wall is the receiver and we are the admirers. Everybody wants a perfectly smooth wall for their interiors but we sometimes get more than what we bargained for. Rough, uneven and not properly detailed wall plastering or rendering are some end results that stares us in the face because we somehow engaged the wrong hands. But that’s not the end of the road.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRendering (or plastering) action on wall usually precede painting. It is the process of applying mortar made from a mix of cement, fine aggregates (or smooth sand) or Plaster of Paris and water to cover the surfaces of block, brick or concrete walls. This process if not properly handled can lead to a bad output. For instance there is often the problem of unevenness in the texture of the finish, flaking-off, breaking edges, cracking, etc. which hitherto affect overall aesthetics and durability. But not all cracks on walls are as a result of poor mortar or rendering work; sometimes it is a consequence of structural defects in the building. Sometimes when this happens, there is a temptation to simply cover it with paints or other finishing material; but that really doesn’t work. The effect of a bad plastering will still resurface with time.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nTalking about getting the job done properly; it is important that the mason team understands the mix ratio for mortar in order to get the right output. They must also know how to use the trowel (or application device) and smoothing devices well. A cement-sand mix ratio of 1:6 -12mm thick is generally acceptable for walls; corresponding to about 3 wheelbarrows of smooth sand to 1 bag of cement. 12mm specified here represents the thickness of the layer on the wall after application.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe nature of sand is also important. The suitable grade of smooth sand for wall rendering is one that contains a good proportion of clay which gives it a tacky or gummy feel. This does not imply the use of pure laterite. The use of sharp sand for rendering should be avoided because overtime pores are generated within the layer that affects the surface texture of the wall. The moisture content in your mortar should be adequate; just enough to make the mix workable. There are special cements used to achieve quality rendering; they were produced with the required functional requirements good mortar\/plaster in mind. It is good to make use of them rather than the general purpose cement so as to obtain great results. It is wrong to use mortar made for setting blocks or bricks to also render your walls. Naturally if you make a bad mortar, you can only expect a bad rendering.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce there is a noticeable defect on a rendered wall, even if it has been painted; it is better to simply chip-off, prepare the surface and reapply properly so that it cures without cracks. Although it may cost more to chip-off old rendering layers before re-applying mortar or P.O.P, the durability potential often override the cost burden, hence making it a cost-effective approach to the alternatives. The use of filling materials to close-up voids in walls to create even texture without chipping off in walls is a welcome development but it is not often the best option; especially if the defect is on a large scale. If you must use filling materials some Experts advice that you drill tiny holes into sections of the wall (using a simple drilling device) to allow for a good grip to the wall; the hole is such as extends beyond the plastering layer well into the wall fabric. Special gums are sometimes used to fill the hole to enhance firmer grip; thereby improving stability.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Bad Rendering or Plastering of your Walls","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"bad-rendering-or-plastering-of-your-walls-here-is-what-to-do","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:16:45","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:16:45","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=8844","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Therefore, it is very critical because the foundation slab actually rests on them. Here are some tips to know when casting ground beams on the casting day (the day concrete is poured):\r\n\r\n<strong>Step 1:<\/strong> At the position where the ground beams will be, a ridge or hole would be dug (not too deep) which would then be blinded with concrete. Then the wooden formwork is erected and the reinforcement bars placed into the formwork following the bending schedule given by the engineer. The height of the formwork would depend on the height of the ground beam to be constructed.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_8866\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-8866 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Erected-Formwork-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/> Erected Formwork[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_8868\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-8868 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Reinforcement-bars-placed-inside-formwork-300x241.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"241\" \/> Reinforcement bars placed inside formwork[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Step 2<\/strong>: There would be reinforcement bars or upbars that will protrude to about 5 feet above the formwork located at the corners or middle of the foundation.

There is a given ratio for the concrete mix, which can be ratio 1:2:4; which means 1 head pan of cement, 2 head pan of sand and 4 head pan of granite will be mixed together in addition of water to form the concrete to be poured into the formwork containing the reinforcement bars\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_8886\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-8886 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Concrete-poured-into-formwork-300x226.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"226\" \/> Concrete poured into formwork[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_8883\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-8883 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Concrete-being-mixed-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/> Concrete being mixed[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_8891\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-8891 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/upbars-protruding-300x188.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" \/> Concrete poured into formwork with plumbing pipes and upbars protruding[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-8889\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Concrete-poured-into-formwork-with-plumbing-pipes-and-upbars-protruding-300x174.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"174\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf the concrete mixer which is to be used in mixing the concrete is bigger than usual, then the mixture would contain one bag of cement, 4 head pan of sand and 8 head pan of aggregate. The size of the granite usually used is the three quarter (¾) inch granite, but all the pieces of granite are not actually the same. At this point, the engineer\/builder who is experienced in building would then decide if more granite would be used over less sand and vice-versa. When mixing the concrete, you have to realize that the type of water used is very important e.g., salty water should not be used for mixing concrete.\r\n\r\n<strong>Step 5<\/strong>: After the concrete has been allowed to set, then the formwork is removed and the ground beam construction is complete\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_8894\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-8894 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Completed-Ground-Beam-with-Form-work-removed3-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/> Completed Ground Beam with Form work removed[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-8892\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Completed-Ground-Beam-with-Form-work-removed1-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" \/>    <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-8893\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Completed-Ground-Beam-with-Form-work-removed2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"><\/div>\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Casting Ground Beam for Raft foundation","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"casting-ground-beam-for-raft-foundation","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:16:36","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:16:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=8854","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Unlike short bored piles, constructing deep piles are normally expensive compared to raft foundations because not only would the piles be installed using various machines or equipment they usually will have large caps and beams constructed over and connecting them respectively. Therefore when cost becomes an issue you can find an acceptable way to run the race and win the prize. Where practically possible and technically okay, a combination of two or more foundation types can be adopted. In practice both raft and pile foundation can be used together on the same structure to achieve a foundation that performs excellently under load and still reduce overall cost and when you choose this option, there are several factors to take into consideration.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor instance you intend to put up a block of 8 flats on four floors; 2 flats per floor and your soil test report allows you to combine pile and raft foundations dependently or independently without necessarily specifying where either of the two should be used, you can in agreement with your engineer\/builder opt to use pile on one wing and raft on the other. In other cases, project owners who intends to build semi-detached duplex and bungalow together or semi-detached duplexes or terrace houses or even two separate buildings lying side by side to each other can use a combination of pile and raft foundations perfectly. The type of foundation arrangement discussed here is not the same as combined Pile Raft Foundations (CPRF) which is achieved by constructing raft over existing piles instead it is about the use of two different foundation types in different locations on the same building or buildings sitting close to each other on the same land.  However in any case, it is important to follow the lead of the soil investigation before venturing.\r\n\r\nTo get the procedure right, basically obtain a geotechnical report (soil test) to know the soil strata and bearing capacities at various depths. Pre-inform the geologist or structural engineer handling your soil test of the type of structure and your intention to combine raft and pile foundation so they can compute various strength characteristics in line with your option. A lot of technicalities are involved in the combination of these two types of foundation especially for the same building but engaging a professional structural engineer will make the work look very easy and the resultant cost reduction is amazing!  For instance the interaction between both foundation elements and the subsoil to achieve maximum functionality are primarily hinged on the characteristic pile and base resistance to load and against settlement hence the foundation must achieve resistance that is sufficient enough not to fail or settle excessively or inordinately at any given time. Also, the internal and external bearing capacities of both foundation elements which border largely on strength of materials used and bearing pressures exerted on, by and around the foundation respectively should be properly analyzed. If you get your procedure right you would have cut some 20% off your foundation cost and that’s huge savings especially on a large scale.\r\n<table style=\"height: 339px;\" width=\"778\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"64\"><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<td width=\"530\">\r\n<table width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Engr.

When an 85 year old woman dies in this part of the world, it is considered more as a celebration than an occasion for mourning. After all with the average life expectancy of less than 50 years, such person has ‘tried’ as the local parlance goes. It never crossed our minds to ask what took the old woman’s life. It was later that we learnt the reason for the tears: the hale and hearty woman who was also very independent had to go the bathroom to bathe, had slipped and hit her head on the edge of the bath tub and must have laid in agony for the next hour before other members of the household were worried enough to check up on her. It was too late by then.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the Publisher limped into the office. On inquiry about the lack of his usual gait, he explained that he had slipped in his bath tub and only quick thinking and grabbing of the towel rail meant that the accident was not more serious that a strained ankle. The two accidents got us thinking: just how dangerous are bathrooms? Ignoring the wise sayings of our resident Pastor to ‘come against the bathroom spirit’, we consulted several doctors, trying to find out how wide spread issues of bathroom accidents are.\r\n\r\n<u>Our informal survey revealed that all the doctors consulted (ten in all) had personal experience of treating serious injuries arising from accidents in the bathroom and one of them had dealt with a fatality due to a fall in this room<\/u>.  This would mean that, although there are no official statistics, the rate of accidents in bathrooms is very high.\r\n\r\nOne does not need to be a forensic detective to understand why more slips and falls occur in the bathroom. Even with ‘slip’ resistant floors, bathtubs and shower rooms\/wet areas, the use of water and soap means that grip will always be tenuous at best. On the other hand, most materials used to finish bathrooms – tiles, granite, ceramic, glass etc. are very hard and can have extremely sharp edges. So a combination of a fall and these materials means serious injuries and even deaths. Some of the doctors interviewed revealed that in some cases the injuries sustained do not appear to have immediate impact but the effects later on affect the quality of life of the victims.\r\n\r\nSo what can be done to improve the safety of your bathroom and guard against slips and falls? There are a number of steps that can be taken (see box) but the most important is vigilance and quick reflexes. Because the reflexes of the elderly are not as fast as the younger ones, they seem more prone to falls in the bathroom and as such their visits to this room should be supervised as much as possible. If this seems onerous, then you can speak to our staff member who discovered his mother on the bathroom floor in a pool of her own blood.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_8931\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"225\"]<img class=\"wp-image-8931 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Include-grab-bars-as-part-of-your-bathroom-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/> Include grab bars as part of your bathroom[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"How safe is your bathroom?","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"how-safe-is-your-bathroom-a-combination-of-soap-water-and-the-very-hard-surfaced-materials-makes-the-bathroom-a-very-dangerous-place","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:07:43","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:07:43","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=8905","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Research has shown that adequate noise control reduces stress levels and reduced stress levels in humans is synonymous with longetivity. Everyone wants to live long and wealthy but living long in big and busy cities where wealth is perceived to be abundant means accepting stress as part of life. Avoiding stress and promoting healthy and peaceful living could mean living below earth but not as a corpse though. Besides, it is generally safer to live under the ground especially in war-torn or conflict-prone regions to avoid straying bullets and other forms of attacks. At a time when insurgency and rebellion has become a part of our society, there is no better time to tilt our line of thoughts towards the design and construction of basement apartments at least for the sake of safety and peace than now.  However glaring the benefits of underground or basement apartments are to occupants, most Nigerians haven’t been able to fully take advantage of it either because of the false fears of the cost implication of such a project or the erroneous belief that there are no indigenous contractors\/builders that can construct them properly.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nCity homes and mansions without basement apartments are like jeans without pockets; they are actually under-utilized. However truth be told, a lot of work goes into the construction of basement apartments; from stopping water to ensuring adequate lighting and ventilation all day long and then working towards the attainment of all other established functional requirements; a process in tandem with the old saying that ‘nothing good comes easy’. Here are few tips to guide you; confirm that no existing laws, bye-laws or regulations bar you from putting up a sub-surface or underground apartment on that land; get a comprehensive architectural, structural and services designs that takes care of space arrangement, lighting and ventilation provisions as stipulated in the relevant design and building codes as well as other functional requirements and get statutory approvals; then, employ the services of a qualified contractor to handle the job. The work processes are as follows; excavate the portion of land to build the apartment using manual or mechanical methods; protect the earth from collapsing by using earthwork supports commonly made from timber or structural steel; construct the basement floor slab over a bed of hardcore and damp-proof membrane using suitable materials like stainless steel or reinforced concrete of appropriate mix. Construct the external walls of reinforced concrete or solid blocks\/bricks and depending on the water table, fix a damp proof membrane over the wall surface and blind properly to stop water ingress and insert a damp proof course to stop water capillarity (upward); allow for openings at surface levels according to the design and ditto for all other works. Only special finishing materials designed for basement structures should be used and care must be taken not to trap workers inside the earth or allow them suffocate in the process of constructing.\r\n\r\nThe cost of constructing a basement structure is not always exceptionally high. For instance, from industry estimates, a budget of 4 Million Naira can complete the construction of a room self-contain basement apartment in the Ajah axis of Lagos (an area with generally poor soil conditions and high water table); only a 55% increase from the cost of constructing the same structure on a surface level in the same area. On the mainland where the soil conditions are relatively better, the cost is pretty lower (down by about 30%). Interestingly, for Estate developers, building sub-surface studio apartments is an added advantage in the market. By and large, the advantages of underground rooms are far beyond mere additional living spaces on the same plot.\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"324\"><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8945\" src=\"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Engr.-Osaz-J.-ENOBAKHARE-MPEM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"222\" height=\"258\" \/><\/td>\r\n<td width=\"464\">\r\n<table width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Engr.

Canal-like <strong>‘V’<\/strong> drainages are taking root in many cities across the country. The advantage of utilizing less quantities of concrete and reinforcement than the regular drainage makes it cost less to construct and relatively flexible. This type of deigns allows the drain to be supported largely by the earth on its sides and bottom than its own weight. Most constructors of this type of drainage use BRC Wire Mesh as the reinforcement material in the concrete mass hence it is relatively light and not safe enough to support drain covers. Although this types of drainage using wire mesh, if not constructed properly are known to fail quickly under intense water pressure-forces. For this reason building a culvert ‘bridge’ over them to allow passage of vehicles become imperative so that the slab do not by any means bear on the drainage to avoid collapse. But the design of slab-culverts is quite different from the usual drain cover supported fully by the drainage because they would have to stand alone. To get it right, you should engage a structural engineer in designing the culvert which takes into account the expected load (or weight) the culvert will bear par functionality. Culverts designed to largely support heavy vehicles, trucks and trailers like those constructed to serve fuel\/filling stations, warehouses, heavy duty parking lots and major streets are quite different from those constructed to support cars and light moving loads for small residential apartments hence the special consideration given to them.  Generally in constructing culverts, you have to;\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Get a structural design.

Their last child had left for school in England seven years ago and one after the other, his three older siblings had indicated that they intended to continue their studies or work abroad.

The second issue was resolved quickly: a three bedroom flat in a serviced apartment block. The first, what to do with their mansion, was more difficult and time consuming. The massive property was impossible to let as there was virtually no demand for such a large property. Selling the property was not a consideration. Culturally, the house is considered as a family asset to be passed on to the next generation. Besides, the couple was put off by sale offers received that valued only the land and put a nil figure on the buildings. According to their agent, buyers do not look favorably on a fifteen year old mansion, even one which was considered as ‘cutting edge’when it was built.\r\n\r\nThe challenge faced by Chief and his wife is getting increasingly common these days. Estate Agents are reporting a new trend of ‘empty nesters’ and ‘downsizing’ in the real estate sector. These are terms that have become commonplace in the West but will become regular in Nigeria, particularly in the luxury locations of the country. Owners are getting to the realization forced on them by maintenance and other costs, that large buildings are expensive to hold on to. Changing cultural norms, like a couple living alone unlike the past when they were likely to house several members of their extended families, is also having an impact. It is more pronounced in the luxury end of the market as owners are faced with children ‘leaving the nest’ to study abroad. What is to be done with the large houses built to accommodate a lifestyle that is changing? This challenge has opportunities for forward-looking owners and investors.\r\n\r\nHow did the big houses come about? Castles Lifestyle wrote about this in 2016.“You have ‘arrived’. Congratulations. Now it is time to put up that mansion that you have always envisaged. A bedroom for every family member and the family dog is in order. What about a room for the grandchildren that will come in future? Now that the bedrooms(all en-suite of course) have been sorted out, what about the living areas? There are the formal parlours downstairs, the family living room up-stairs and surely there must be an anteroom to receive such callers like the mechanics etc. who cannot be invited into the main sitting room. There’s also the small matter of political ambitions so there must be another parlour where top-level consultations with ‘my people’ can be held in secrecy. Apart from the living areas, there is also the prayer room, the study and the gym where Oga can go a few rounds on the treadmill.\r\nIn the meeting with his architect, the owner of this castle can probably justify why he has to have a mansion with so many rooms. Many years down the road when the cost of maintaining it is over bearing or the owner has passed on and the children are saddled with the property, the sagacity of putting up the humongous structure is in doubt. Now it is difficult to sell or rent it and none of the children want to live there. Speaking with several agents who advertised such grand family homes, we find that such properties can be on the market for upwards of two years or more but still cannot find buyers.\r\n\r\nWith this hindsight, one would have thought that such overbuilding would have died out but while most modern Nigerians would claim that they do not believe in big houses, let a few millions of Naira hit their bank balances and voila a 13-room castle is built. If you really must have that grand house, do go ahead but instruct your architect to design it in such a way that it can be divided into various apartments with few modifications and no structural work required. That way, the ten bedroom house can be converted into an apartment block of four flats or two semi-detached houses. These could be more easily let as separate apartments, sold as investment properties or divided among the children who will find them easier to live in than the decaying monument to ego their progenitor built!\r\nThe advice of 2016 is still relevant today. Even if there is a predilection for a large house, the owner should consider how the house can be divided up into smaller units for letting or resale.\r\n\r\nThis has implications for owners in estates like NICON Town, Northern Foreshore and Charlton Gate Estates in Lekki where the building approval rules mandate a house on a plot. Owners of the large houses will have their options severely limited in this regard.\r\n\r\nOn the development side, Developers can also consider developing properties suitable for this demographic of geriatric buyers! The Osborne Towers complex might have achieved notoriety for the stash of foreign currency unveiled by a whistle blower but the news inadvertently revealed the profile of the owner\/occupiers. Not expatriates as might be expected but well heeled Nigerians who by their pedigree should be in mansions in high-end locations but preferred flats in the serviced apartment block . Retirement housing may not have a market in Nigeria at the moment, but as our habits continue to reflect those of the western world the more, Highbrow Living may be penning an article on the topic in a few short years.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Empty nests and downsizing","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"trending-empty-nests-and-downsizing","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:07:00","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:07:00","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=15120","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Leasehold properties unlike Freehold properties have a lease term usually of up to 999 Years (virtual freehold). When buying a property the lease term is important before committing funds as you might only know the true position when the solicitors get to work, so unlike damp or structural cracks, where the detrimental effects on value are easy to see and quantified, it nonetheless can be detrimental to the value of your property at its most extreme.\r\n\r\nStatistics indicate that there have been more first time homeowners in the last 15-20 Years than ever before. Most of these new homeowners are often sadly unaware that there is a ticking bomb or value loss inherent in a low lease that can accompany their purchase.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nPrior to the year 2000, most flats were purchased with an unexpired lease of between 90 and 99 Years, with the property boom and aggressive new build developments leases are now mostly drawn at 125 years.\r\n\r\nMost accidental landlords, Buy to Let owners and indeed homeowners that have owned their properties for over 10 Years have focused more on the capital appreciation and better rental returns to be gained due to low interest rates and higher rents, losing sight of the capital cost that might be required to extend their property lease.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Why is it important?<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n1. Banks and mortgage lenders are uncomfortable with short leases and are particularly interested in the number of Years unexpired when a loan is granted i.e. a property with a 63 Year lease being mortgaged over 25 Years would have 43 Years left in Year 20 of the mortgage and might have adverse effect on the value of the property due to low unexpired lease.\r\n\r\n2. The cost of extending a lease becomes higher the lower the lease becomes an example is a client we are presently negotiating on behalf of: The flat was bought in the Year 2001 at £140,000 with an unexpired lease of 54 Years, he negotiated with the freeholder to be granted an additional 90 Years at £10,000 which was agreed but not concluded due to disagreement on who would pay the legal cost, 14 Years later he initiated negotiations again with the freeholder, with the property now having 40 Years unexpired lease and now valued at £400,000. The cost of extending the lease was quoted at £78,000, as expected the leaseholder was astonished and opted to instruct his own valuation which pretty much confirmed the same figure.\r\n\r\nThe value of the lease is usually tied to the area where the property is situated, which can again be loosely correlated to the value of the property. We've renewed a lease in central London for as much as £750,000, so you could very well see a case where properties with identical lease cost vary vastly, £750,000 in central London and as low as £10,000 elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe point at which you need to start looking seriously into negotiating a lease extension is in the 70 to 80 years left period. If you had bought a property in 2008 with one of the characteristic 99 year leases of the time for instance, you are getting into borderline low lease territory.\r\n\r\nYou become free to negotiate the lease extension on your flat once you've owned it for north of 3 years and your freeholder is duty bound to deal with you, if your landlord or Freeholder refuses to do this or you can't seem to settle on an agreeable price, there is always recourse to the court of arbitration.\r\n\r\nBelying all this is the fact that leases are increasingly looked at as cash cows by developers and freeholders alike. Gone are the days where ground rent was at peppercorn value, with people paying between £1 and £10. Today we see rates of about £500 every half year with provisions embedded in contracts for increases periodically. RPI (retail property index) is now increasingly used as a parameter for ground rent charges.\r\n\r\nThe way some leaseholds are structured in new builds have rendered them simply unattractive to secondary buyers, with the escalating ground rent being a major turn off. There have been growing reports of new home buyers complaining of deals falling through for this very reason.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>What next?<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\nCheck the unexpired term of your lease.\r\n\r\nApproach your freeholder for a quote to extend.\r\n\r\nAppoint a good Solicitor or experience Property consultant to advice or act on your behalf.\r\n\r\nGood news is that your mortgage lender would consider equity release to fund the cost of extending the lease as it enhances the value of the asset.\r\n\r\nRemember that every passing day your lease decreases, the cost of extending probably increases, so start the process today.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Do you own a Flat in the UK?","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"do-you-own-a-flat-in-the-uk","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:06:58","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:06:58","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=15199","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

DANstudio was briefed to transform it from a shell into a family home. To do this, the studio came up with a design that focused on ventilation, lighting and nature. It involved cutting holes in the floors, replacing opaque walls with semi-transparent screens, and adding plants both inside and out. To do this they added a screen of aluminium slats, which fronts a wall of glazing and a series of balconies. Big shelves create places for displaying pot plants.  This design can work on facades in Nigeria which need extensive burglar proofing – this will help soften the steelwork and presenting an interesting look for the building, especially as the plants can be changed (or rearranged) from time to time.<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-16955\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/article-2-300x225.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-16956\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/article-3-300x225.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-16957\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/article-4-300x225.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>","post_title":"A flowering façade!","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"a-flowering-facade","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 01:06:48","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 01:06:48","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=16948","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

WOODstyles has always been an associated brand to this event.\r\n\r\nAt the 2017 event, WOODstyles had an array of its bespoke products. Thus, offering to the guests, variety of options to make their interior space a tasteful delight. The company demonstrated its core competence in producing quality joineries and wood fittings that can match international standards. On display, are bespoke designs of fitted kitchen as well as a mockup of a hotel suite; comprising wardrobes in exquisite natural oak veneer, a king size bed, dressing table, upholstered sofa set, and other accessories. The booth attracted a mix of well-known interior designers, architects, as well as real estate developers, who were impressed that such quality wood works are now available in Nigeria.\r\n\r\nWoodstyles aim is to produce locally, but compete even globally; while discouraging consumers from importation. All products are manufactured in the company’s facility in Lagos, Nigeria. The company has been able to achieve this fit by investing in new technologies in joinery manufacturing and assembling a highly competent technical and commercial team to deliver a world class customer service.\r\n\r\nThis year’s edition promises to be even better. With plans to showcase more customized designs in interior woodwork, cutting across residential, commercial and hospitality sectors.

Today we begin with Kings Cross, located within Zone 1 and a deep history within the city of London.\r\n\r\nKings Cross is named after a monument of King George IV that stood between 1830 and 1845 and marked the point where Euston Road, Grays inn road and Pentonville road met. Hence the name of the Kings Crossing. The area today is light years away from the aforementioned description and has experienced a Cinderella-like transformation from its designation in the 90’s as a red light district, to a formidable cultural and tech hub that boasts the most connected transport hub in Europe.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world where travel time is the new conception of distance, six London Underground lines, two mainline stations and an international high-speed rail link all within a few hundred meters, make Kings Cross a commuters dream. One of the largest regeneration schemes in London's recent history has seen the addition of three million sq ft of workspace, 500,000 sq ft of retails, restaurants, bars, cafes and other facilities, as well as over two thousands of new homes.\r\n\r\nThis renaissance has attracted companies such as BNP Paribas, Google, and Facebook, with the latter two sitting their European headquarters there. For the investor this spells out a compelling case, Kings Cross has become both a destination and a transit hub, with space to Live, work and play. This means a large supply of potential tenants that are willing and able to pay the rent expected of such an area.\r\n\r\nThe price appreciation of an asset is as important as the yield obtainable and is a signal of the underlying strength in the area. We’ve attached a few examples of price movements in the area over time gotten from the Land Registry. The British library, UAL, Kings Place (home to the Guardian newspapers) make it a real prospect in the near future and with the price still below the monopoly areas average, this might be the next big opportunity.\r\n\r\nPrice movements in Kings Cross\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24107\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/pic1-300x48.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"48\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24108\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/pic-300x50.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"50\" \/>\r\n\r\nProperties for sale in Kings Cross.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24109\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/pic3-300x213.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"213\" \/>\r\n\r\nPlimsoll, Canal Reach, King’s Cross, London, N1C\r\n\r\n£1,100,000\r\n\r\nThis apartment on the 8th floor of the iconic plimsoll building offers two double bedrooms, large open plan kitchen and living area, two bathrooms, one of which is en-suite, and a roof terrace.

In the following pages, we reproduce from the Report, the firm’s reading of the residential, office and retail markets.\r\n\r\n<strong>RESIDENTIAL <\/strong>\r\n\r\nResidential markets showed improved price stability and levels of activity in comparison to H1 2017, though fairly high but reducing vacancies exist in the high to mid income locations. As land prices and other construction costs soar, developers continue to stay competitive by intensifying land use, reducing plot sizes, car parks and built-up areas in a bid to supplement the decline in profitability caused by weakened prices since 2016\/17.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nThere is a general improvement in design and finishing features provided in recent developments, however, the quality of materials and workmanship can be improved on and remains a major differentiator. However, residential developments in close proximity to high streets and areas with high traffic continue\r\n\r\nto be gentrified i.e. converted to other use classes that attract higher rents such as retail and office use.\r\n\r\nTo foster housing provision, the Central Bank selected 34 mortgage banks and 4 commercial banks to increase access to housing finance for low-income earners. The banks will benefit from a $15M Housing Micro-finance Fund and a $10M Technical Assistance Fund. Furthermore, the CBN engaged the Mortgage Bankers Association of Nigeria (MBAN), the Nigeria Mortgage Refinancing Company (NMRC), Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria and Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) to launch the Uniform Mortgage Underwriting Standards for the informal sector.\r\n\r\nIn another public-private partnership effort, the Kaduna state government entered a partnership with Sterling Bank to launch a ₦5Bn fund aimed at providing mortgages at single-digit interest rates. Beneficiaries are required to make security deposits of between 15 to 30% of the value of the houses but would be expected to liquidate mortgages within 10 years. This is in addition to the foundation laying for 600 housing units, a five-star hotel and two shopping malls in the state.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) also completed 608 housing units in Borno State as its contribution towards rebuilding areas destroyed by Boko-Haram. This is as a 72- unit housing project under the National Housing Programme in Jigawa state attained 80% completion. The MPW&amp;H would also engage 20 local contractors in Sokoto to construct an 80-unit housing estate worth N1.3Bn. The Edo State Government started the construction of 1,800 housing units in partnership with MIXTA Africa - a property development company with projects spread across Africa. Completion is expected by Q4 2019.\r\n\r\nProperty values remained linked to location, infrastructure availability, perceived levels of security and historical antecedents. This was evidently the case in the ‘Garden City’ of Port Harcourt. Still, Federal Government- owned Trans Amadi Gardens was in fair demand. High-end rents for 3-beds went between ₦4 – ₦6M per annum as sale prices averaged ₦45 – ₦60M. Peter Odili, NAF Harmony estate, Trans Amadi Garden, Old GRA, and GRA Phases 1 – 3 ranked highest on the most desired places to live.\r\n\r\nVacancy rates in Lagos showed slight improvements with Mainland strongholds - Yaba (3%) Surulere (4%) and Magodo Phase II (5%) recording the lowest vacancies of the nodes considered. The more cosmopolitan areas of Victoria Island (35%), Oniru (37%), Lekki (39%) and Ikoyi (40%) had higher vacancies, as affordability remained a central consideration. Flexibility also featured in many residential areas with some Landlords willing to offer monthly or quarterly rents.\r\n\r\nAbuja’s city centre saw high demand for low cost 1 and 2-Bed apartments while that of 3 to 4-Bed houses saw a drop in demand due to the weakened purchasing power of the average resident. High tenement rates, waste management and water bills contributed to the reduced interest. To increase the housing supply in the FCT, the Federal Government would partner Zvecan Consulting and a Chinese firm, Wengfu Company Limited to build 5,000 housing units under the Federal Integrated Staff Housing (FISH), programme. Vacancy rates in Abuja ranged from 3% (Maitama) to 28% (Katampe)\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24117\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/pic5-153x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"153\" height=\"300\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24118\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/pic7-300x217.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24119\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/pic8-300x188.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" \/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Put the retail with the diagrams on one page… <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>RETAIL <\/strong>\r\n\r\nRetail continued to struggle with the shrinking middle class and the dwindling purchasing power of the customer. However, with the exchange rate stabilization, planning around operational costs and profit projections is much more feasible for retailers. Local investors, emboldened to make further investments, softly opened the Next Mall in Port Harcourt and The Atlantic in Lagos.\r\n\r\nVacancy rates largely reduced across the Grade-Amalls. The Palms and Ikeja-City Mall had the lowest vacancies at 0% and 2% respectively. Novare Mall came in at 28%, down from 47% at the end of 2017. Artee’s Port Harcourt Mall, Big Treat and Genesis Centre had 8%, 15% and 25% respectively. Ceddi Plaza and Gateway Mall in Abuja recorded 21% and 38% respectively. Abuja’s largest mall – Jabi Lake (20,000sqm) recorded the highest vacancy rate in city – 40% due to a number of stores that closed down in Q1 and high rentals. While some international investors find business conditions less favorable and are instead pursuing retail interests in Eastern Europe and Eastern Africa, local HNI’s (High Net- worth Individuals) who are not disturbed by currency risks amongst others, are moving into the retail space to make large-scale investments.\r\n\r\nOutside purpose-built and A-grade malls, high street retail within central locations continue to experience high demand. Larger malls, though more appealing to international retailers due to better infrastructure, are less attractive to local brands due to higher rents and service charge costs. Events, entertainment and leisure features continue to be a traffic pull for large malls with car park payments remaining a key income stream and a counterweight to the pain of declined rents in major malls.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24121\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/pic9-300x124.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"124\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24122\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/pic10-187x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"187\" height=\"300\" \/>\r\n\r\n<strong>put the office with the diagram and contacts on one page<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>OFFICE <\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe office market in Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt continued to struggle in the review period. Rents either stayed or declined to remain competitive. The security risks and environmental hazards in Port Harcourt sent office rents to its lowest in over five years. Grade-A office vacancies in particular remained high and it appears the economy would need to strengthen much more to reverse this trend. The wait for the global brands looking to open up shop in Grade-A signature addresses worthy of their presence may be taking too long.\r\n\r\nDemand for grade B and smaller office spaces remained stable when compared with last year and co-working spaces continue to grow in popularity with a few service providers opening more locations. With increased flexibility in pricing and terms, a renewed focus on volume, partnerships and programs that drive profitability.\r\n\r\nThe development pipeline remains rich and is much more active in comparison to H1 2017. With over 100,000sqm of office currently available for lease on the market, completions scheduled for 2018 already have significant competition for the few multinationals and big brands that can afford grade-A space, not accounting for the brands that are willing to settle for the more flexible and affordable co-work option.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24123\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/pic11-279x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"279\" height=\"300\" \/>\r\n\r\nContact  North-court .\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24125\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/pic12-300x109.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"109\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Northcourt’s Nigeria Real Estate Market Review H1 2018\u2028","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"northcourts-nigeria-real-estate-market-review-h1-2018%e2%80%a8","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-27 08:09:05","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 08:09:05","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=24095","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The chances of it being built are slim but we are still enamored with the striking good looks of the concept to feature it. Life, after all will be boring without dreaming.\r\n\r\nThe looks of the car has brought out the poetic in the Mercedes Benz PR Team- “<strong>The Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet is a car which, with its sensual, emotionally appealing design and innovative technical concept solutions, defines the ultimate in luxury of the future. At the same time the two-seater model pays homage to the glorious \"automotive haute couture\" of hand-finished, exclusive cabriolets. The glamorous cabriolet reinterprets classic, emotional design principles in an extravagant way and combines intelligent beauty with classic, aesthetic proportions and a reduced, technoid appearance – a perfect embodiment of the design philosophy of Sensual Purity.”<\/strong>\r\n\r\n“Measuring almost six meters in length, the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet incorporates the classic proportions of art deco design with its extremely long bonnet and puristic, flowing lines, and at the same time completely reinterprets these aesthetic principles. The curved basic body boasts a sporty, stretched design which is characterized by powerful structural elements in conjunction with the sharp feature line. This side feature line defines the upper vehicle body, from the radiator grille across the entire length of the vehicle through to the rear.\r\n\r\nThe strong contrast between the dark blue paintwork in \"nautical blue metallic\" and the chrome highlights increases the fascinating relationship between the clearly defined areas with organically shaped wings and the chrome trim elements, which sit at the top on the edge of the wing as well as in the middle on the boot lid, where they also incorporate the vertical brake lights. This benefits the interpretation of the Mercedes-Maybach radiator grille, which with its fine, vertical struts accentuates the front end. The grille was inspired by a pinstriped suit. The radiator grille rests on two aerodynamically shaped supports on the outer right and left of the bumper.\r\n\r\nThe newly designed 24-inch light-alloy wheels feature a centre lock. This is painted in rose gold and as such reflects the colour shade used on all electric vehicle studies from Mercedes-Benz.\r\n\r\nThe extended, round \"boat tail\" format of the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet's rear recalls a luxury yacht, and narrow tail lights which emphasize the width of the vehicle are integrated in its outer edges. Further distinctive features at the rear include the diffuser with aluminium frame and the air outlets behind the wheel arches.\r\n\r\nThe transition between the vehicle rear, the area of the boot lid and the interior boasts a flowing design. Crystal white high-quality nappa leather creates an exciting contrast to the dark paint finish.

As the company’s managing director, Kfir Rusin, says, “Nigeria is a bellwether economy in Africa and when it expands; it impacts regional and global sentiment across Africa, which is driving a major swing towards Africa’s premier emerging markets.”\r\n\r\nThis year’s summit theme: RE-Calibrating Supply and Demand for Sustainable Growth is a natural evolution of the previous year’s theme, Changing the West African Narrative, which aided more than 400 delegates representing over 250 companies to reposition the sector in a region sparked to a growth footing by Nigeria’s resurgence.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n<strong>A re-calibrated market<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAs Rusin says, “After years of challenging conditions, the question facing the local market - and what our regional and international investors and developers will explore is: How has the market re-calibrated and evolved to cater towards changing end-user demand and regional market realities in an economy flush with $70 oil? We believe the market has matured through these lean years, and we’re seeing a change in the market which includes more purpose built and tailored projects, which will be unpacked in detail by the developers, tenants, operators and new entrants.”\r\n\r\nThis year’s key focus areas include: Funding; Non-traditional Asset Classes; Proptech, Innovation and Big Data; Affordable Housing, Retailer Occupier and End User Product Demand and Infrastructure, Planning and Permits – with such detailed discussion topics, the WAPI Summit is regarded as the year’s definitive annual real estate forum for the region.\r\n\r\nAs Rusin says, “We’ve witnessed continued development across Africa and Nigeria is attracting a lot of attention from industry stakeholders from funders, developers, retailers, hospitality and operators. And by exploring these topics in-depth, we will provide the market with the platform for growth by sharing unique insights case studies and high-level networking opportunities.”\r\n\r\n<strong>Speakers in attendance<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSome of the first C-Suit level presenters and panel discussion thought leaders to confirm their participation include Olasupo Shasore (SAN), Partner at African Law Practice, Ali Djire, Fraym’s Country Manager, PwC Nigeria’s Chief Economist Andrew S Nevin, Fola Aiyesimoju, Founding Partner, Themis Capital Management, Kehinde Ogundimu, Managing Director, NMRC and Broll Property Group Nigeria’s CEO, Bolaji Edu.\r\n\r\nAs the continent’s largest economy, Nigeria is a key focus point for the investors and developers and this year’s theme and agenda is reflective of the increased regional and global appetite for real estate assets in Nigeria and Ghana says Rusin. “Nigeria’s exit from recession at the end of 2017, changed perceptions and once again catapulted the region back onto the radar of investors, which is evident by the uptick in transactions this year, which we have noted across multiple sectors.”\r\n\r\nHaving hosted multiple events across the continent, 2018 has provided ample opportunity for Rusin to gauge international and regional appetite and performance. “We’ve witnessed a recovery and maturing and improved appetite for diverse assets in the market – with new funds launched and a lot of deal making throughout 2018. However, we have also noted volatility in global markets, which have impacted Africa, but bullish developers continue to forge ahead across the continent’s most appealing markets.”\r\n\r\nWith a large proportion of the 450 delegates representing more than 250 companies travelling from across the region, and further afield, the WAPI Summit provides unique networking and deal-making opportunities. “Over the years, we have seen numerous multi-million-dollar deals struck and introduced development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds and private equity firms who are increasingly interested in the opportunities in West Africa.”\r\n\r\nEnds\r\n\r\n<strong>About API Events <\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe West Africa Property Investment (WAPI) is the region’s largest and most premier real estate event.

A few of these retail facilities had full occupancy whilst majority of them were obviously struggling to let their spaces. Since then, I have made it a habit to study commercial retail developments whenever I find myself in different localities, cities and states away from Lagos.\r\n\r\nIt is quite obvious that this trend of high vacancy in commercial retail facilities is not restricted to certain areas within the Lagos metropolis; Be it Maitama in Abuja, Kaduna central, Port Harcourt City, the story is the same. Sprawling all over the place are retail facilities which are struggling to achieve 70% occupancy rate. This is as a result of one key problem which most promoters of malls\/shopping centers have repeatedly failed to accept as the prime factor in determining the success of such developments. <strong>IT’S THE TENANT MIX, STUPID!<\/strong>\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nPardon me on the choice of the phrase which I feel is most appropriate to capture my observation and comments to developers of shopping centers. The title of this piece was inspired by the phrase “The Economy, Stupid” which has turned out to be a popular cliché’ commonly used in American political discourse over the years. For political history buffs, it was coined as a campaign slogan by Mr. James Carville and used during the successful 1992 presidential campaign of a certain Mr. Bill Clinton.\r\n\r\nIn my school days at the University of Lagos, our lecturers consistently told us that as far as real estate is concerned, it is all about the location- Location! Location! Location! In the numerous books written by Donald Trump - a real Estate mogul and now President of the United States in my crowded office library, he has repeatedly emphasized the importance of getting the best location when dealing in real estate. Well, I am of the view that when it comes to real estate especially as it regards commercial retail, It’s not all about the location.\r\n\r\nMost of the malls\/shopping centers in the major cities in Nigeria are in fantastic locations but are struggling to achieve full occupancy. While some people attribute it to the bad economy and exorbitant rents being charged by the promoters of the retail facilities, I am of the strong belief that it all boils down to the tenant mix.\r\n\r\nWorldwide, it has been an accepted norm for those in the commercial retail space that for any retail facility to thrive, high footfall has to be generated. Once this is achieved, the tendency for all shops to be let out is very high as retailers would ensure that their businesses are situated in such facilities. With high occupancy comes higher income and thus a better investment performance of the property for the promoters of the facility who more often than not borrow money to develop such properties.\r\n\r\nFor a decent footfall to be achieved in a mall\/shopping centre, key human traffic generators have to be carefully selected to take up space in the facility even if it means giving these retail brands concessions in rent, fit out cost, and free trading periods.\r\n\r\nFor the Nigerian market, the human traffic drivers can be segmented into 3 categories: Supermarket\/Grocery\/Departmental stores; Entertainment\/Leisure- Cinemas, Game arcades, Bars\/Lounges; Food &amp; Beverages -QSR etc.\r\n\r\nAny retail facility in a good location that has a combination of these 3 drivers stands a chance of attaining a high level of occupancy. In centers that are on multiple floors, it is wise to situate these drivers on different floors. Without strategically placing these drivers all around the centre, there would be a tendency for the upper floors to still remain vacant as most retailers would focus more on the floors that are perceived to have more traffic. A good example where the tenant mix has worked in facilities that have multiple floors is the Maryland Mall on Ikorodu road in Lagos. The mall went against tradition by placing drivers on other floors apart from the ground floor, which is typical in most retail developments in the country. That is the main reason why the mall was able to attain 75% occupancy on the opening day which happened at the heat of economic recession in the month of June, 2016.\r\n\r\nWith the traffic drivers being correctly identified and allocated shops, it usually becomes easier to attract other retailers to the facility.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of commercial retail facility promoters are ignorant of this fact and believe that once the properties are built, they would be easily leased. “Build and they will come” as the saying goes but people tend to forget that the only reason why the average retail brand intends to take a space at a facility instead of a stand-alone property is because there is an assumption that such facilities generate human traffic which would give them a better opportunity to find patronage for their goods and services. From my experience, there are instances, where irrespective of the traffic pullers, these centers have been fully leased. However, come a year after, most of these tenants vacate the centers as a result of low patronage; it becomes hard to justify the high rental. So isn’t it better to do it right from the onset?\r\n\r\nOver time, I have had cause to discuss with some of these promoters of such facilities and a few accept my argument. The biggest obstacle is usually the discounts required to entice the supposed traffic generators to their facility. The demand by these retailers are at times as good as giving them spaces of between 1,000 –1,200sqm in a facility of 3,000-5,000sqm GLA almost for free. In the Entertainment and Leisure segment, most of the retailers now request for the retail centre owners to bear part of their fit-out costs as a condition to taking up space at the centre.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate solution to avoid these financial issues especially at a later stage when the centre is fully operational is to ascribe a certain percentage of GLA to anchor tenant and key tenants when preparing the financial model at the conception stage of the project. This would have taken into consideration the discounted rents prescribed and resources allocated to take care of these set of tenants. By so doing, financial pitfalls would have been avoided in future.\r\n\r\nIt is my hope that my article has steered some taught in this area of practice.

His story….\r\nMany people had rejected the bungalow, which had been abandoned for many years. As we can see from the ‘before’ photos, the exterior and interior of the property was not attractive to say the least. But this reader looked at the property as a blank canvas to achieving a great outcome.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n“I was advised by many, including experts, to avoid the property. But I saw beyond the poor layout, grime and dirt and had a vision of what it could become. Also, because of the state of the property, I was able to get it at a relatively good price.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I did was to gut the entire property. I changed the layout by moving the entrance to the side of the property. I also rearrange the living area turning it into an L shape and incorporating the kitchen as part of the space. I know that this is not common in Nigeria but I have lived in England for a number of years and I was comfortable with the idea. It makes the space look bigger and brighter.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/how-to-construct-a-slab-culvert-over-a-drainage-engr-osaz\/\"><strong>Also Read: How to Construct a Slab Culvert Over a Drainage<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo incorporate more light, I made the windows bigger and increased the number.

(WHICH SOUNDS BETTER?)<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nLondon Property Eyes\r\n\r\nIn business terminology, the phrase cash is king is often heard. By and large, any business owner would tell you the same, liquidity is incredibly important to the survival of any organization. Likewise, with individual investments, it’s important to have some regularity of cash flows, as people who have been stuck with Lands or assets they can’t sell or tenants who can’t make rent payments can testify.\r\n\r\nAmongst various investment options, property is one of the most tried, tested and proven strategies to sustain liquidity. We feel London property investment in particular and what we call the 5k income model is able to meet the long-term objectives of the average investor. A significant percentage of expenditure for most international owners of property is in Foreign exchange which is usually paid out in the form of school fees, holiday expenses, and medical fees.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nWe chose the £5k number in specifics because for most people £5000 per month covers more than the basic requirements of living. You may not be able to spend 7 nights at the Penthouse suite of the Dorchester hotel, but it guarantees you a decent holiday in almost any location worldwide. The fact that the pound retains its strength is also significant, for most overseas investors, its a great parameter of lifestyle. For example, in the past, you could have bought a new car for 3 million Naira, but now that same car would cost you 15 million Naira. That 3 million Naira then was £10,000, but today £10,000 is just under 5 million Naira. So the pound stands the test of time and is a good proxy to plan future spending. Whether or not all your expenditure is in Naira, you shouldn’t invest solely in Naira. But especially so if you enjoy holidays abroad or want your kids schooling outside Nigeria. After all, there is a reason all countries have foreign reserves.\r\n\r\nAny investor in property needs to hold a long-term view. Historically rent rises crudely in tangent with inflation. A case study in point is of a client who bought a 1-bed property in Islington, North London for £130,000 in 2000. The property was rented for £680 at the time, with a mortgage of £630. Fast forward to 2018 and the value of the property is now £450,000, whilst the rental income of the property is now £1750 with the mortgage having dropped to £320 per month. So the property has moved from positive equity of £50 per month to £1430 per month. This is in broader terms an annual positive equity of £17,160 and a valuation boost of £320,000.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/london-property-eyes\/\">Also Read: Area Spotlight: Kings Cross, London<\/a><\/h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHowever, In this piece, our focus is on rental growth, not the capital appreciation. If this same model is replicated with 3 or 4 properties, we would achieve our model target of £5000 per month income during your less active retirement years. When starting up the £5,000 of rental income may have a mortgage liability of £4000 - £4600, but as the years roll by the rent rises and the mortgage repayments drop. This model has worked for a lot of our clients and helped sustain their lifestyle at the latter end of their careers and old age.\r\n\r\nThe model is also flexible. We have had clients that have attained the £5k target and then chosen to increase it over the years. One of the things that makes this work is the fact that interest rates in the U.K are relatively low and stable. The other thing that is crucial is the fact that tenants pay their rents monthly. So when there are issues it's quicker to identify problems. Unlike other climates with longer tenures like annual payment.\r\n\r\nThis model is best begun when the investor is still active. As when there are void rental periods, the investor is able to cover shortfalls. However, we are confident that your long-term life goals would be well catered for if you put in the fiscal and sweat equity now.

The aim is to ensure that transactions are concluded seamlessly and conflicting interests of the various parties to the transaction are harmonized. Our role in any given transaction depends on the structure of the transaction ie. whether it is a transaction for the sale and purchase of real estate or a Joint Venture for the development of real property. We shall discuss STL Trustee’s role under a Joint Venture for the development\/redevelopment of real property. The property to be developed or redeveloped can either be residential or commercial or both.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>WHAT IS A JOINT VENTURE?<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nA joint venture (JV) is a business arrangement in which two or more parties agree to pool their resources for the purpose of accomplishing a specific task. This task can be a new project or any other business activity. In a joint venture (JV), each of the participants is responsible for profits, losses and costs associated with it.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Use of Joint Ventures in a Real Estate Transaction:<\/strong><\/span> A real estate transaction can be structured as a Joint Venture where the owner of a large parcel of land may wish to develop same either as a residential property or for a commercial property including a shopping mall, for sale to eventual buyers but lacks the financial or technical wherewithal to execute same and rather than simply employing the services of a contractor to execute the project may decide to enter into a Joint Venture with a developer for the development of the property. In this case both parties share the costs and liabilities that will be involved in the development.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the size of the project may even require the developer, who is the party usually tasked with providing the finance for the development, to approach Financial institution(s) or lender(s) to access finance and in most cases using the project as security. The financier may decide to be part of the JV in which case, the transaction will be structured to accommodate the various streams of financing involved in the JV.\r\n\r\nIn either structure, the services will require that a Trustee be appointed to manage the transaction to give comfort to all the parties. The Role of STL under this type of transaction will usually include the following:\r\n\r\nTake custody of the title documents on behalf of the parties to the transaction;\r\nHold on behalf of stakeholders, all rights and benefits that accrue under the transaction;\r\nEnsure proper registration of titles under the transaction;\r\nCo-coordinating, perusing and generally reviewing the Trust Deed and other transaction documents;\r\nMonitoring obligations under the Trust documents as well as managing the Trust relationship generally;\r\nProtect Stakeholder’s interest;\r\nWhere the interests of the Stakeholders will not be jeopardized, authorize waivers and modifications as may be required;\r\nEnsure compliance with the terms of the Trusts Deed\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/structure-your-firm-to-get-international-client-fiabci\/\"><strong>Also Read: Structure your firm to get International Client – FIABCI<\/strong><\/a><\/h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>BENEFITS TO THE PARTIES:<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\nThe above role we play as Trustees provides the following benefits to the parties, in addition to general Trusteeship and advisory services.\r\n\r\nThe comfort of having a neutral legal entity act as intermediary between parties to Real Estate transactions to ensure transparency;\r\nGives the Prospective Off-takers to the project the confidence to release part or all of the Purchase price even before completion of the project;\r\nProvides custodial services for Title documents;\r\nPrevents the transaction from being frustrated in the event of any unforeseen occurrence;\r\nIt effectively protects the often conflicting interest of Land owner, Developer and the Financier(s);\r\nIt rescues transactions from being frustrated by parties who are not willing to take risk with their respective assets;\r\nIt makes property sale a win-win transaction.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Contact:<\/strong><\/span>\r\n<strong>STL TRUSTEES LIMITED<\/strong> is a corporate Trustee registered authorized by the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission to carry out the dual functions of Trusteeship and Funds\/Portfolio Management\r\nSkye Bank Building (3rd Floor)\r\n30 Marina, Lagos.Tel:+234-1-6311264; +234-8103385944\r\nEmail:stl@stltrustees.com\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Trustees in Real Estate","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"role-of-trustees-in-real-estate-transactions","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/structure-your-firm-to-get-international-client-fiabci\/","post_modified":"2018-11-27 08:05:40","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 08:05:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=30141","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

To help our 500 delegates unpack these changes – we’re pleased to announce that we’ve secured more than 60 well-known regional and international thought leaders to speak at #WAPI2018. These include, Broll Nigeria’s CEO, Bolaji Edu, regional legal authority, Olasupo Shasore (SAN), Ali Djire, Fraym’s Country Manager and PwC Nigeria’s Chief Economist Andrew S Nevin.”\r\n\r\nAs the head of one of the region’s largest multi-disciplinary commercial property services providers, Broll Property Group’s Bolaj Edu’s, position provides him with a unique position to gauge how the market has re-calibrated post-recession.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nAs Bolaji says, “If we analyse the grade-A office market in Lagos and the overall retail mall market following the economy entering a deep recession in 2016; take up dropped by approximately 40% (offices) and 55% (retail) between 2016 and 2017. However, as the economic recovery strengthens, we have seen numbers flatten out, and we expect to see an increase over the whole of 2018 from the low point of 2017.”\r\n\r\nAnd while Bolaji argues that the drop-off proved challenging it did enable the market to strike a balance, especially at the height of investment – with property values reaching sky high levels. This boom, he says can be attributed to the post 2007 global recession economy whereby investors fueled by low interest rates entered emerging markets aggressively searching for high yields.\r\n\r\nAs Bolaji explains, “We don’t expect to see the same level from the institutional international investment community, which lead to emerging market currencies being too strong and artificially inflated the size of the economies and the size of the middle class in USD terms.”\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>A More Sustainable Market:<\/strong><\/span>\r\nFollowing this inflation and subsequent re-adjustment, Bolaji believes that the market is now on a more long-term stable footing. Commenting that: “The market has begun to rebase itself down from a level where rent levels and capital values in parts of Lagos were comparable to the wealthiest cities in the world such as New York and the out skirts of London.” For him, this is most evident in the reducing rates in the commercial and retail sectors, which are now at “more sustainable levels,” he says.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking results of this re-calibration are the new strategies employed by developers to cater to demand and not “copy &amp; paste” and a change in the demographic of international retailers drawn to the market’s demanding and aspirant middle-class.\r\n\r\n“Developers and investors in the market are examining building size and design that better reflect the target market. It is important to entertain best practices and the latest trends from around the world, but we need to tailor our projects,” says Bolaji.\r\n\r\nAdding that the region’s market size and growing demand from the middle-class means that retailers and companies still wish to establish a presence in Nigeria. “However, they are looking at this more strategically taking into consideration both the potential risks in addition to the incredible upside opportunities. International investors and retailers are seeking more partnership opportunities.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/role-of-trustees-in-real-estate-transactions\/\">Also Read: Role of Trustees in Real Estate Transactions<\/a><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Market Trends:<\/strong><\/span>\r\nAs the market continues to evolve, Broll has deduced several key trends emerging within the local retail space says Bolaji. “We see local retailers driving demand for retail space especially in secondary locations, while international retailer demand is predominantly driven by retailers from Europe and the Americas, whereas historically, Asian brands were the most aggressive.” Adding that the biggest demand driver in existing malls is food and beverage.\r\n\r\nAs the market continues to evolve and re-calibrate in line with economic development – Bolaji has noted the demand continues to be driven by the high end and budget segments. “These are the two areas that we see most inquiries from both investors \/ developers and retailers and corporates.”\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Rising Oil Prices:<\/strong><\/span>\r\nWhile the rising oil price continues to be of benefit to overall regional GDP growth, Bolaji believes that one market seeing un uptick from oil’s surge is the office sector with occupier demand being driven by the oil and gas sector. While this may not reach the highs of previous eras, especially as many of the new firms are local oil servicing firms. The trend he believes is driven by the fact these local companies can enjoy shorter timelines when closing transactions compared to their international counterparts.\r\n\r\nRusin concludes sharing Bolaji’s views, “We’ve witnessed continued development across Africa and Nigeria, and as an African bellwether economy – what happens in Nigeria sends ripples across the continent from an investment and trend perspective. I believe Bolaji’s presentation and together with other leading panel lists will aid us in achieving our key objectives of: identifying the critical shifts in consumer, occupier and retailer demand, and how these changes will shape the future of the industry.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>About API Events<\/strong> <\/span><\/em>\r\n<em>The West Africa Property Investment (WAPI) is the region’s largest and most premier real estate event.

Owners of high end properties are in his radar…<\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt’s pretty difficult to hide a Grade A office block of ten floors. An eighteen storey tower of luxury flats is impossible to overlook. And so, for many signature properties in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt etc, their owners are subjects of speculation, not only for the general public but increasingly, the tax authorities. Most owners utilise companies as special purpose vehicles to acquire their assets and the strategy of the taxman is to tax the corporate structure itself.\r\n\r\nAs the Chairman of the FIRS, Babatunde Fowler, said at the recent Annual General Meeting of the Nigerian Employers Consultative Forum (NECA) in Lagos, “We are not taking property tax. We look at corporate properties in the name of corporate organization. Because we found out corporate organizations, limited liability companies were not filling any returns but we noticed that they own properties.So we started a process in Abuja. We found that property worth N4 trillion in those corporate names have not paid any tax. People fund companies, file no return and then use them to develop properties.”\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nThe position of the FIRS in such cases, is to apply the the law, that companies that don’t file or keep any record, the FIRS will take its turnover as a basis to compute tax due by such company. The FIRS will take 20 per cent of that turnover as the assumed profit and tax it at 30 per cent. “So if you have a property worth N100 million, with that computation, we charge you N6 million. That is basically what it is. It is not property tax, we are just using turnover to estimate the tax you pay” the Chairman said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/property-experts-predict-sustainable-growth-for-real-estate-sector\/\">Also Read: Property experts predict sustainable growth for Real Estate Sector<\/a><\/h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“We started at home in the Federal Capital Territory, and we established over 2,000 properties and land that were built or developed in corporate names and limited liability companies. The value of these properties is in excess of N2tn, and they (the owners) have never paid any taxes for them. We have contacted them and sent them our assessments. A number of them are paying.\r\n\r\n“But for those that have owners that are not paying, we will go to court to get the approval or court order to sell those properties. We are not only doing that in Abuja. We have concluded in Lagos; we are currently going to Osun, Oyo, Kaduna; and eventually, we will cover the whole federation.”\r\n\r\nFeelers by Highbrow Living have confirmed that indeed, a number of properties have been caught in this process with owners caught out, negotiating their assessments with the FIRS rather than taking the matter to the courts for a judicial pronouncement. In a tough environment for property owners, there is something else to fear: an assessment from the FIRS.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Fear of Fowler's FIRS","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"the-fear-of-fowlers-firs","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/property-experts-predict-sustainable-growth-for-real-estate-sector\/","post_modified":"2018-11-27 08:07:32","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 08:07:32","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=30180","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

But my ‘errand boy’ status may be coming to an end as she now does her shopping at a nearby mall. I was abit surprised at this because she and my mum belong to the older generation of Nigerians that travel to Lagos Island and visit places like Apongbonand Oke-arinto buy consumer goods and foodstuffs for the month in bulk. My aunt in her remarks,wondered why she should ‘stress’ herself under the hot sun and go that far when youcan get everything at a reasonable price within the anchor shops of the mall which is in close proximity to where she lives. Well, thanks to the anchor tenants in most malls, they havegiven most people, young and old a justified reason at least to visit shopping centres\/malls.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Why anchor tenants are vital<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessdictionary.com\">www.businessdictionary.com<\/a> defines anchor tenant as “Usually the first, and the leading, tenant in a shopping center whose prestige and name recognition attracts other tenants and, it is hoped, shoppers”.They serve as the primary traffic generators and are expected to make the centres economically viable. InNigeria, they are mainly departmental store branches that trade consumer goods in different product categories such as clothes, electronics, groceries, furniture, householdappliances, food, drinksetc. Also quite common are the retailers in the Entertainment and leisure category such as Cinemas, game arcade centreswhilst the others common to this class usually deal and trade in white consumer goods such as refrigerators, washing machines and large pieces of electronic household equipment.\r\n\r\nMy article would not please a number of shopping centre promoters, as it might seem to be placing much emphasis on the importance of the anchortenant. The truth is that they are indeedsignificant and are the keysuccess determinants of most retail facilities.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Understanding anchor tenants costs<\/strong><\/span>\r\nIt’s a known fact that most traditional anchor tenants demand for an arm and a leg before they agree to secure a space in most facilities. This puts most promoters off from the onset and thereby make them consider brands that might not be ideally suitable for the space being leased. Thereasons for their consistent demand for lower rents and perks is notexaggerated however. It boils down to the cost of fitting out, stocking and carrying out their operation in such shops. In the entertainment and leisure segment forinstance, setting up astandard 4 screen cinema in a 1,000sqm retail space would cost an average of $1million(approx N365m).This is excluding the rent and the service charge.For the supermarkets that comprises of the butchery and the bakery, the average cost is N130,000-N200,000\/m2.Unlike the cinemas,this excludes the stock, the trading equipment,rent and service charge.\r\n\r\nEven though this columnist has not analysed the average cost of fitting out similar spaces in shopping centres outside Nigeria,it isquite obvious that it would be costlier in the country when considering the fact that most of the equipment and items used are imported.The eventualcost of procuring such foreign exchange to import the goods is very high and usually makes the whole venture highly expensive from the start.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The symbiotic relationship<\/strong><\/span>\r\nThe mall promoters should start looking at the anchor tenants as partners and consider supportingthem in their various businesses knowing fully well that once they succeed andare profitable, the likely chance of the mall to be successful is very high.This could be done by both carrying out joint marketing sessions, promotions, regularbrand activation to promote the brands, road shows, etc.\r\n\r\nDue to their strict adherence to standard and the importance most anchor tenants place on fit-out, most traditional anchor tenants carry out their fit-outthemselves. What is required in most cases from the developer is to provide a shell which would have taken into consideration the required head room and M &amp; E requirements. Mall promoters could assist anchor tenants such as cinema owners in supporting them further by carrying out additional works in their spaces such as soundproofing of the entire space, tiling and provision of ceiling cover.\r\n\r\nJoint venture initiatives between the mall promoters and the anchor tenants should also be considered. Thanks to modern technology, there are better ways to monitor revenues generated from retail sales.This will help clear the doubt of most mall promoters on the workability of the initiative as the technology deployed would help provide the needed accountability and transparency.\r\n\r\nGranting the anchor tenants free trading periods is usually a good way of supporting their business too as they would be able to recoup a part of their start-upcost.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Not just any anchor tenant:<\/strong><\/span> The choice of the anchor tenant is also quite crucial and can make or mar the overall viability of such facility.There are a lot of mistakes being made in this area by retail shopping centre promoters all over the country. Some years ago, I was opportuned to consult for a mall developer who was building a facility with a GLA of about 3,000m2. The facility is situated on a prominent road and is surrounded by multiple estates with residents having good spendable income.I tried to let him accept a big supermarket chain which had the full compliments of a general store,pastry and bakery to cater for the class of the immediate locality but he rejected them due to the low rent they were offering.\r\n\r\nHe ended up leasing the space to a supermarket eventually.I was at the same facility some weeks ago and even though the anchor tenants are in place, the mall is only about 30% occupied. Before a major space is leased to an anchor tenant, market research has to be carried out on the population statistics, demographics and lifestyle of the trading area. This research would help determine the quality of the anchor tenant that would be required to help drive the traffic in such facility and also attract other retailers to the centre.\r\n\r\nIt is important to realise that most of the traditional anchor tenants like most businessmen all over the world are all concerned about the bottom line which is, making profit. In making decisions as regards the location to set up and the retail facility to be considered, they also would determine the kind of consumer goods to trade in such locations.\r\n\r\nTherefore,beyond considering the brand of the anchor tenant and the market research outcome, the retail facility promoters must properly look into the consumer goods to be traded to ensure that it would be able to fully attract all categories of consumers coming into the mall. Effort has to be made for all shopping classes to be covered in terms of product offerings. The product offering invariably defines the shopping class coming to the mall. Therefore, don’t just consider an anchor tenant by its brand identity but also consider properly what its offering. The mall might be better off with an unknown brand than one that brings the name but fails to supply the full compliment of options.\r\n\r\nThe summary of the story is that both the retail facility promoters and the anchor tenants should realise from the onset that they are partners and they need each other. The landlord needs a primary driver of traffic whilst the anchor tenant requires a facility with a good tenant mix that would attract consumers to buy its goods and generate profit to its shareholders.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Danger from the okadaman?<\/strong><\/span> There is currently a rising trend where retailers in the traditional markets are now heavily deploying the use of technology to link up with their customers. They now provide homedelivery service(by men on motorcycles known as okadamen)to their customers for all kinds of consumer goods. The anchor tenants most especially the supermarkets in most cities are yet to provide these services.\r\n\r\nNigeria has a youthful population with 65% of our population between the age bracket of 18-35 years. The people in the category are easily influenced by social media and they embrace technology. More than ever before, employers of labour are demanding more from the working class. This reduces their free hours in a typical day. In North America, Amazon has caused a major disruption in the commercial retail industry. The introduction of Amazon Fresh – the arm of the company that delivers everything from fresh meat and chicken to farm fresh vegetables and fruits even more so. It’s hard for you to find any supermarket or departmental store that doesn’t have a section of the business that caters for internet shopping or home deliveries. The demography and the work culture in the country today supports it and should be provided for by most supermarkets and departmental stores.\r\n\r\nThe upsurge in the development of shopping malls\/centres for the past decade is a welcome development and has shaped the shopping experience from what it used to be. However, we are entering an era where a sizeable section of the populace would patronise more of retailers that can deliver consumer goods to their homes and offices than visiting such retail facilities.\r\nJust Imagine if my Aunty had the number of her retailers in Apongbon and they could provide home delivery service.

The investor or landlord who ignores how his tenants and real estate assets are treated does so at his own peril. The icing on the cake in this very competitive market is FM; hence Landlords must ensure that their facilities management standard is commensurate (or even surpass) the tenants’ expectations. <\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Engr. Femi Akintunde explains in this article, that the investor\/landlord’s quest to exceed tenant’s expectation must start with the budgeting process ...<\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe aspect of budgeting for facilities management or maintenance as it applies to the investor is not what a lot of people consider to be an important exercise. A lot of property investors don’t do it –people take it as ‘I will spend when I need to spend’.\r\n\r\nSo, when you are considering your annual budget for all your expenses, including children’s education, household expenses for food, medical insurance and so on; you must understand that your physical environment – home, office, etc also needs to be budgeted for. This will help you determine how well these budgeted costs fit into the resources plan expectation and expenditure.\r\n\r\nFor real estate, if you spend on your buildings without planning for it, you cannot control your costs. You will end up spending more than is required. The budgeting process enables you to anticipate events. It enables you to prevent crisis, to be better prepared you for any emergencies, and to put contingency plans in place in case of shortages or inadequacies.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of budget planning for your real estate asset is that you are able to get better prices than if you have to do negotiations at short notices. For example, if a heavy-duty generator that is to be serviced every 250 hours is planned for, you will have an idea of how much every servicing costs. You will have an idea of how long it takes to get to 250 hours; so you will be ready to meet the costs and schedule the servicing at a time convenient to all.\r\n\r\n<strong>[read more=\"Click here to Continue Reading\" less=\"Read Less\"] <\/strong>\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you increase the tendency is to run the generator beyond the recommendation hours and get a breakdown. Then the pressure comes to fix the generator before residents arrive or start to complain. You will have to buy parts under emergency and many times you end up spending more. The risk of buying inferior quality is also very high in unplanned situations. There will also be the attendant effect of the impact of this breakdown on your tenants’ lifestyle (or business in the case of commercial spaces); and this will come into play when they are considering renewing their leases.\r\n\r\nHow does the budgeting process take place? There are two aspects: the capital and operation budget.\r\n\r\nOperations Budget is for the expenses that you incur to maintain the asset in a form that will continue to deliver the expected services without necessarily increasing, renewing or modifying the existing capacity. Key considerations in an operation budget are Personnel costs, admin costs &amp;consumables, and third-party services.\r\n\r\nWorking on the Operations Budget raises the question of providing services in-house or outsourcing to an FM company. This is a question that is best addressed on its own merits; but my general advice is that the choice of one over the other will depend on the size, scope or variety of services the asset requires.\r\n\r\nIf the in-house option best suits the circumstances, then during the budgeting process, you will have to look at the salary and emoluments of the staff members engaged in the facility management duties and compute the costs for the budget year or period.\r\n\r\nThe second line under the Operations Budget is the tools and equipment that they will use. There are two categories of tools and equipment. There are Management Tools like laptops, telephone etc and operational tools and equipment like toolbox. Consumables refer to items that run down in the course of usage – brooms for cleaners, washing liquid, toilet roll. Generator servicing parts like filter are also involved. These sounds mundane but there are clear examples of even Grade ‘A’ office complexes without toilet roll or hand wash soap in their washrooms.\r\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/30183-2\/\"><strong>Also Read: Hail The Anchor Tenant<\/strong><\/a><\/h3>\r\nThird Party Services are items that you have to call specialist companies for. Generator maintenance, Refuse collection, Swimming pool maintenance, Lift maintenance and so forth. It is advisable to sign a service contract and on that basis, you factor in the costs into the budget.\r\n\r\nIf you outsource the facility management function, the process is relatively easier as the FM Company will come up with the budget. Typically, the FM Company’s budget highlights the various services and their costs but power is separated from these into its own category.\r\n\r\nMany of these services are the planned services – like security, cleaning, swimming pool maintenance etc and as the name implies, planned services should be quite certain – you can see and plan ahead. Note however that provision should also be made for unplanned breakdowns. For instance, it is impossible to predict when a door handle will malfunction or a pump will break down. So, we advise that about 20% of the planned budget be set aside as provisional sum for unplanned activities.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that the FM Company and the owner agree on this because when the unplanned events occur, each party will be looking to the other to finance the repairs. Another point to note is that the Landlord\/Investor should also add into the budget, the cost of his own staff who will be the liaison with the FM Company.\r\n\r\nIn the next segment of the article, we will be looking at the capital budget and the best practice in the industry when budgeting for power for real estate assets.\r\n\r\nYou can send comments, questions etc to Engr Femi Akintunde on highbrow@castles.com.ng.

Venturing within its borders were feats thought to be reserved to either the brave hearted or very foolish. Whilst popular for being the home ground of the Premiership football side Tottenham Hotspurs, it became more infamous for the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot, the 2011 Tottenham riot, and gang crime.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-31571\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Spotlight-on-Tottenham-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"441\" height=\"295\" \/>\r\n\r\nThat narrative, however, is fast becoming the tale of a Tottenham past. The postcode’s chequered past has seemed to be a catalyst for a regeneration akin to that of the Kings Cross and Paddington area, that is bringing about a positive change to the area. Investments to date of over £1 billion from the public and private sector alike has birthed a new stadium, 10,000 new homes, and a £100m new Tottenham Hale station.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Continue Reading\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nThe new stadium, set to open later this year, will be the largest capacity football club stadium in London, creating a new sports and leisure destination for the capital with a hive of activity 365 days a year, a new museum, an innovative Skywalk, 21st century retail experiences, first-class conference and banqueting and high quality leisure facilities including restaurants and a hotel – and will attract in excess of two million visitors per year. Supporting the stadium development will be a vastly improved local transport infrastructure, including redeveloped stations at White Hart Lane and Northumberland Park and upgrades at Tottenham Hale. The arrival of Crossrail 2 will further enhance an area that is already highly accessible by public transport.\r\n\r\nThe Club scheme has kick-started regeneration plans to the east and west. The Club has to date already delivered 258 new homes, 100 percent affordable, the new Brook House Primary School on the site of an old rubber factory, the 78,000 square foot Sainsbury’s supermarket and the London Academy of Excellence Tottenham school (LAET). Lend-lease also signed a £1 billion development deal with Haringey Council to regenerate the area around the site of Tottenham Hotspur's new stadium in north London, with the promise of 2,500 homes and 3,000 new jobs over the course of the project which begins in 2018. Plans and images describe public spaces with shops and restaurants, a community park, library, community center and a new Tube station that will help with getting fans to and from the new stadium once it has been opened.\r\n\r\nIn a recent questionnaire we held, transport came up top as the chief consideration we take to account in the selection of where to live for first-time buyers. Closely followed by affordability and the intuition makes sense, whilst you are just getting your feet planted in life, you want to be as close to jobs as possible. A criterion sufficiently met by Tottenham which is in Zone 3, a short ride from the city of London's financial center. For a wider perspective, there are journey times of 15 mins to Liverpool Street, 20 mins to London Kings Cross, 14 minutes to Stratford and has the Stansted Express to Stansted Airport.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/step-into-a-world-of-beachside-luxury\/\"><strong>Also Read; Step into a World of Beachside Luxury<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best reason to consider Tottenham as an area to live or invest is the property price, which is relatively lower than most neighboring areas (DATA). In a time of unaffordable housing, Tottenham represents one of the few truly good deals for first-time buyers and investors, with its Victorian houses becoming increasingly popular with young professionals and families that have been priced out of Hackney for instance.\r\n\r\nWe believe Tottenham to be one of the open secret London property success stories, and one that is long overdue at that.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-31572\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Spotlight-on-Tottenham-2-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"470\" height=\"315\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPrice: £250,000 - £280,000\r\nRental: £1,400 - £1,700 per calendar month\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Property Eyes: Spotlight on Tottenham","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"spotlight-on-tottenham","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/step-into-a-world-of-beachside-luxury\/","post_modified":"2018-11-27 08:03:37","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-27 08:03:37","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=31570","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Once such arguments starts, just know your event has developed another life on its own. From a football enthusiast standpoint, both players each have their fans and nothing under the sun would ever change their mind about their position and justifiable so as both players have various attributes that make them so unique and great. It all depends on the kind of attributes that endear you to the player. The same can be said of International and local retail brands.\r\n\r\nThere has been a rapid influx of International retail brands into the country over the past decade in Nigeria. This can be attributed to the increased foreign direct investment which targeted the promotion and development of commercial retail centres of international standard in the country.\r\nThis happened to be a blue ocean area in the country at the time and given the fact that most markets in southern Africa, Europe and the Americas were becoming saturated, it was definitely inevitable for such investments to make way into the country. The big international retail brands also were filling the pinch in these countries and they also created an expansionist plan in Africa with Nigeria being at the centre of their plans.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nThe successful entry of the Mobile telecom giants and the Pay Cable TV promoters were also good reference points as to how profitable business could be in the most populous black nation in the world.\r\nMajority of the malls in the country which we call ‘’GRADE A ‘’ derive most of their financing from international foreign lenders and banks that have foreign affiliation. For a mall promoter to have a chance of being funded by these companies\/institutions, there has to be a certain percentage of off take tenants willing to lease the shop spaces before being considered for funding. The International retail brands are usually the first set to be approached especially in the anchor tenant’s category. Irrespective of their credit worthiness, capacity and the market demand for such brands in the local market, there is usually a demand by the financiers to secure these brands in the malls first before considering the local players. Furthermore, there has been a general acceptability of International retail brands by Nigerians. The bullish nationwide roll out of such brands in the business of departmental store\/ supermarkets seems to give credence to the success of the brands in the country.\r\n<h5>Also Read:<\/h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h5><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/spotlight-on-tottenham\/\">Property Eyes: Spotlight on Tottenham<\/a><\/h5>\r\n<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h5><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/step-into-a-world-of-beachside-luxury\/\">Step into a World of Beachside Luxury<\/a><\/h5>\r\n<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h5><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/budgeting-for-facilities-management\/\">Budgeting for Facilities Management<\/a><\/h5>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf you enter any supermarket in most of the Grade A malls which are mainly international brands, you would observe that 85% of goods displayed and sold are locally produced. I have also observed that majority of the workforce in most of the shops that have international retail brands are Nigerians. There are now local retailers in all retail category segments. It is common place to see local departmental stores on high streets these days. The question then is ‘’What’s stopping the local brands from dominating the commercial retail space’’?\r\nIt could be argued that it boils down to finance which the international retails have access to easily in single digits compared to the double digits that the local financial institutions provide to retailers in the country to ply their trade. Finance could be part of the problem but is it really the major problem?\r\n\r\nTo compete favourably with the international retail brands, there is need for the locals to run proper outfits governed by strict corporate governance which adheres to certain standards and principles. There has to be continuous update of their knowledge on modern management practice, most especially in the area of supply chain management and technology.\r\nCreating a unique brand is non-negotiable in Nigeria. The average Nigerian is a believer and loves the best things in life irrespective of his level in the society. With the right exposure and training on how to properly run a business, the sky is the limit for the average retailer operating in the remotest parts of the country. The funding would eventually come.\r\n\r\nThere are good examples that the locals could relate to. In the healthcare sector, Healthplus started from a small shop in the heart of Ikeja over a decade ago. Now,this company operating in 48 locations was just recently able to get US$18 m investment from Alta Semper Capital LLP, a private equity manager investing flexible and strategic capital across select African growth markets. I fondly recollect that the founder of the outfit delivered a lecture at the Lagos Business School in 2014 where she talked about the company and the processes being used to run the outfit. I was therefore not surprised when I heard about the news some months ago.\r\n\r\nIn a volatile economy like Nigeria, any retail facility needs the best of both worlds. Some years ago, when there were sudden changes in policy and it become difficult to obtain foreign exchange and the attendant cost, the newly developed malls during that period suffered greatly. It was mainly the local brands that were able to lease shop spaces. Some retailers even had to halt their roll out plans due to the disruption brought about by the government policy. Indeed, the gap between the international and local retail brands as regards brand identity especially in the anchor tenant segment is closing and in not too distant future, I see both brands almost at par with each other. Quality and standards would always be at play whether the brand is international or local.\r\n\r\nOn my answer to the best player debate,It’s neither of those two players.I am not even going to suggest Maradona or Pele.My choice, King Kenny Dalglish MBE.

In a market under pressure with retailers struggling with under performing new locations due to steep competition and a lack of critical consumer mix, access to data is increasingly transforming the fortunes of companies in the sector.\r\nSays Djire, “The need for a data-driven approach is becoming an imperative for retailers to not only inform what products to carry on the shelf, but also to get unprecedented insights into where to locate their stores, how to price based on ability to pay, and how to respond to competition.”\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>RETAIL’S GROWING VALUE TO THE NIGERIAN GDP:<\/strong><\/span>\r\nAccording to Djire, retail currently accounts for 16% of the Nigerian GDP and is viewed by many as a new frontier of growth for local and international investors.\r\nA view which is shared by Jan Van Zyl, head of property development for leading pan-Africa real estate development fund, Novare Equity Partners.\r\n“Nigeria is the largest economy in Africa. Therefore, you cannot brand yourself as a Sub-Saharan Fund and not have a presence in Nigeria.” Adding that the fund is also looking at options in Ghana and Cote D’Ivoire.\r\nWhile the scale of the opportunity in Nigeria has attracted many entrants over the past decade, experienced investors and developers understand that the formal retail market is limited and dynamic that can grow exponentially.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>$300 MILLION INVESTED:<\/strong><\/span>\r\nAs Van Zyl explains, “We believe that we are at the right place, at the right time, and we have invested in four shopping centres in Nigeria since 2010 with a book value in excess of $300 million.”\r\nAs one of Africa’s bullish international funds in real estate on the continent, the pan-Africa fund is in the country for the long-term. However, while the recovery over the last 12 months has been slow, Van Zyl argues that this is not a Nigerian, but an emerging market phenomenon.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>RECOVERY AND ELECTIONS:<\/strong><\/span>\r\n“Combined with elections in February 2019, we find that many potential new entrants are waiting on the sidelines until the uncertainty surrounding an election period has settled. It is important to note that, such a cycle is not Nigeria specific, but is experienced in most emerging markets throughout Africa and other continents.” However, he does note that there has been a trend of decreasing the size of future shopping centre developments in the current market, which is one way in which the market has recalibrated to cope with market relating to the recession.\r\nFor Kfir Rusin, the Managing Director of the WAPI Summit, the advent of data and new technologies are critical to quickening the somewhat slow pace of recovery in the retail sector post-recession.\r\n<h4>Also Read:<\/h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/international-brands-versus-the-locals-the-debate\/\">International Brands Versus the Locals: The Debate<\/a><\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/spotlight-on-tottenham\/\">Property Eyes: Spotlight on Tottenham<\/a><\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/step-into-a-world-of-beachside-luxury\/\">Step into a World of Beachside Luxury<\/a><\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>THE FUTURE:<\/strong><\/span>\r\n“As a pioneer in their field, Fraym’s use of Geospatial data, AI and Machine Learning technologies can provide actionable intelligence on communities down to 1 square kilometre across the country. This unique and relevant data has the potential to be transformative catalyst of growth for the retail sector.”\r\nWith such useful smart data increasingly, many large market layers are actively recalibrating their approach. As Djire reveals, “We are actively working with global investment players, development organisations, as well as local companies, to get actionable market insights. Through our data, we are seeing early signs of companies leveraging Fraym’s geospatial data platform to streamline their operations and retail strategy. We see a growing need for actionable data for companies to be able to make effective decisions.”\r\nAs Rusin says, “This year’s West Africa Property Investments (WAPI) Summit will provide a platform for the traditional retail sector to network and realise the real-world benefits of how relevant data and tech is essential to growing the formal retail sector.”\r\n\r\nFor Djire, WAPI is a platform for engagement. As he says, “WAPI is the platform where the message of a data approach in retail could gain grounds. There is a unique opportunity to engage directly with decision-makers, demystify the concept of [geospatial] data, walk them through the idea of a data approach and how it could affect their business and bottom line. More importantly, it’s an opportunity to hear from them about the ways they think about the market, their business, and their consumers, to ensure that we’re all on the same wavelength.”\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>About WAPI:<\/strong><\/span>\r\nThe West Africa Property Investment (WAPI) is the region’s largest and most premier real estate event.

Today, in 2018, the same plot is slightly above N200m. So anyone who paid for the plot in 1999, would have made N198m profit on the transaction. The N198m is what is known in investment terms as capital gains. Capital gain is the difference in the value of the property down compared to when you bought it. Rent as we discussed last week is what the property owner gets from someone who uses the property for a while. Major difference between rent and capital gain in cash-flow terms is that you can continue to enjoy revenue (rent) by giving up possession of the property for a period. You don’t give up ownership of the property. But for you to enjoy the cash from the increase in the value of the property, you have to sell.\r\n\r\nThe point that you have to sell to enjoy the capital gains* is very important when we are considering real estate investment. This is because as a general rule, property tends to appreciate. So even if you buy property as your home or for rental income, the value will go up. As you don’t intend to sell these properties, that is outside of our consideration here. We are looking at a scenario where you buy property with the express intention of reselling it for a higher price at a later date.\r\n\r\nWhat factors do you have to consider when you are buying real estate to sell at a higher price subsequently?\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Holding Period:<\/strong><\/span><strong> <\/strong>First is how long do you want to hold the asset before selling? Accepted wisdom is that the longer you hold, the higher the price. So if you want to hold for a short period, say between a year to two years, then there must be a factor or factors that will make the price move in such a short (for real estate investment) time. One is shortage of supply. If there is only one plot of land left in a desirable estate and you have the money, you can reasonably expect that within two years someone will come to buy the property at a premium. Another factor that can make property desirable is if some deficiency is going to be cured. So plots of land around the route of the new rail line in Lagos which suffered from poor transport links to the city centre, will become more desirable when the line is complete. Or land covered by a ‘mere’ Letter of Allocation, which is considered as an inferior title will be cheap but as soon as the Certificate of Occupancy on the property is processed, the price goes up. So for quick transactions, there is some skill. For long term, say about 5 years, buying in areas that are not well developed and so reasonably cheap, is a good way to invest. As soon as development reaches the area, the price would have gone up and you can sell. Locations like Ibeju Lekki and the Mowe Ofada axis are good for this kind of strategy. Having said that, four years ago, land in Lekki 1 was trading at around N150m per 1,000sqm plot and today, such plot is going for N200m to N220m.\r\n\r\n<strong>Read Also:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/data-tech-to-transform-nigerian-retail-market\/\">Data &amp; Tech to Transform Nigerian Retail<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/international-brands-versus-the-locals-the-debate\/\">International Brands Versus the Locals<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/spotlight-on-tottenham\/\">Property Eyes: Spotlight on Tottenham<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Land or developed property<\/strong><\/span><strong>: <\/strong>Second factor you should consider is whether you should buy land or developed property. Developed property means you can enjoy a hybrid return of rents during the holding period and also enjoy capital gains when the property is sold. This means that you have to invest more money as developed properties generally cost more than bare land. You also have to get into the management of the property during the holding period. It also appears that it is generally, easier to sell land and the returns better than developed property.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Transaction Costs:<\/strong><\/span><strong> <\/strong>A third factor to consider is cost of the transaction. Buying and selling land is not cheap. Agency fees can be anything from 5% to 10% of the price of the property. Perfection (Governor’s Consent and Land Registry registration) could add another 10% as fees. When selling the investor is also subject to Capital Gains Tax on the profit he had made on the transaction.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Rate of return:<\/strong><\/span><strong> <\/strong>In the good old days up to 2010, property values could double in a year. In 1999, a 675sqm plot of land in Victoria Garden City sold for N1.7m. Three years later, it was N12m. But those days have gone and property price rises are more conservative now. So it is up to the investor to check if the capital gains he is expected are commensurate to other investments like shares, Treasury Bills etc\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-34309\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"418\" height=\"407\" \/><\/a> [\/read]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Gains on property in these tough times","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"gains-on-property-in-these-tough-times","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-19 09:24:26","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-19 09:24:26","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=34307","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

This growth is going to be centered in urban areas like Lagos.\n\nTen to fifteen years ago, Lekki was not a prominent thought in the mind of a lot of people investing in property, but today through the efforts of Lagos state, population increase, the expansion of the Lekki-epe expressway and the soon to be opened Lekki-ikoyi link bridge, Lekki peninsular scheme 1 can be labeled a success. It is one of the leading suburbs in the city where people can work, live and play all in the same neighbourhood. This was not always the case though; Ten years ago, one could find a thousand square meter lot in Lekki phase 1 for One Million Naira, today that same lot would command no less than a hundred times that amount. The question now is, in 2028 where would we look at and wish we had invested in in 2018? Would that be Lekki Scheme 2, Epe, the free trade zone or even Otta? It is not a matter of if, but when, population scientist are predicting that our population in cities like Lagos and Port Harcourt will double within the next fifteen years, how will you cash in?\n\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\n\n<strong>Think Long term:<\/strong>\n\nIt is important to note that the modern family goes through several cycles; there is the beginning stage when a couple are newlyweds and need decent size space, typically 3 bedrooms to start. The family grows, and has three, four or maybe five children and requires more space both inside the house and outside. At this point people we start to see the seven to ten bedroom homes, then there comes the stage when the children start moving out and getting married and before you know it the house is empty, just the man his wife and a lot of vacant rooms. It is at this point we see the older parents leaving these ‘empty nesting” homes and opting for small spaces as they did in the beginning stages of their family, the difference now is they typically have more financial ability at this stage of their lives and want nicer neighbourhoods. So what happens to these empty nester houses? It is harder to rent and maintain a 10 bedroom house than it is let a three or four bedroom apartment. Keeping that in mind can inform the design of a house so in future it may be easier to partition and break down into smaller units or be converted into alternate uses.\n\n<strong>Read also:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-cantilevered-room\/\">The Cantilevered Room<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/african-reinsurance-corporation\/\">Africa RE to build Corporate HQ in Abuja<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>Running cost:<\/strong>\n\nQuite simply the upkeep of a house is directly proportional to the size of the house. It might seem like a good idea at the time to build the biggest thing one can afford, but as time goes on repairs and maintenance would have to be done on the house and this can get very pricey the bigger the property. For one, there is increased electricity and water consumption which add up over time. It is a great idea to try to balance long term housing needs with long term cost of maintenance.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_40312\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"467\"]<img class=\" wp-image-40312\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/new-1-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"467\" height=\"313\" \/> Spectacular mansion- but what is the cost of maintaining it?[\/caption]\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\n\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Three things you don’t think of when buying property","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"three-things-you-dont-think-of-when-buying-property","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-cantilevered-room\/","post_modified":"2019-01-13 18:48:20","post_modified_gmt":"2019-01-13 18:48:20","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=40311","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Not Eko Atlantic City, Banana Island, Asokoro or Maitama. All those locations have a lot to commend them and put them in the running for top spot but as the massive projects sited in Ibeju Lekki take off, the promise of the area is more obvious.\n\nThe Lekki Free Trade Zone, Dangote Refinery, Dangote Fertilizer Plant, Lekki Deep Sea Port, Lagos Fourth Mainland Bridge and Lekki International Airport are all planned for this location.  While the fate of such large projects are always suspect in Nigeria, two factors give investors cause of guarded optimism that most of them will be completed: private sector interest and the continuity in the Lagos State Government.\n\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\n\nSome may argue that Ibeju Lekki, like other outlying areas of Lekki always had latent potential. As was the case for Ikate Elegushi, then Agungi, the Chevron etc, demand and high prices of mature Lekki locations will compel interest in outlying areas like Ibeju Lekki. True, but because of the employment generating capacity of the projects in Ibeju Lekki, people are not only going to live here- <strong>they will work here as well<\/strong>. Not only will the projects employ people directly, they will also attract businesses to the location as well. It is not far-fetched to predict that the Lekki Deep Sea Port will create another ‘Apapa’ type location in the location. Unlike Sangotedo or Ikota, Ibeju Lekki will be a complete town with self-sustaining commercial life compared to other areas where people live but go to work or school in Lekki 1, Victoria Island, Ikoyi etc.\n\nThis has implication for all stakeholders: Government, businesses, real estate developers\/investors and potential residents of the area. For Government, the planning imperative is clear. If they are to avoid the mistakes of Lagos – trailers parking on the road, traffic gridlock etc, a proactive approach to how the area develops has to be taken right away and maintained over the formative years of the location. Real estate developers have to think beyond the residential estate as the only type of business that can flourish here. Business parks and other commercial real estate and even tourist based real estate will work here.\n\nFor Ibeju-Lekki, it is a matter of ‘when’ not ‘if’.\n\n<strong>Read also:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/versahitversadot-compact-and-versatile-independent-power-sockets-sockets-by-asaplastici\/\">Compact and independent power socket<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/three-things-you-dont-think-of-when-buying-property\/\">Three things you don't think of when buying property<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>Ibeju Lekki Projects &amp; likelihood of success<\/strong>\n\n<strong>Assessment by MCORE (MCORE.co)<\/strong> a Nigerian real estate investment firm.\n\n<strong> <\/strong>\n<table width=\"604\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\" width=\"604\"><strong>Lekki Free Trade Zone (LFTZ)<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\" width=\"604\"><strong> <\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"104\"><strong>100%<\/strong>\n\n<strong>Chance of success<\/strong><\/td>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"378\">The LFTZ was established as an industrial and commercial hub for West Africa.

This month, they will get free tickets to the Davido Christmas Concert and other high profile events. When they travel, they are treated like royalty, enjoying premium luxury airport lounges even when they are flying economy class and discounted rates on hotel reservations. Who are these ultra HNIs?\n\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-40339\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/V-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"362\" height=\"241\" \/>\n\nMrs Kari Tukur, Diamond Bank’s Country Head, Consumer Banking and Privilege, stifles a giggle as she explains (for the umpteenth time) the bank’s  unique proposition known as <em>Xclusive Plus<\/em>.\n\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\n\n<strong>“<\/strong>Diamond bank tries to include as many different customer segments as possible and offer unique services to them. Up until the middle of this year, we had an offering called the Exclusive Current Account.  This account was positioned to speak to the needs of the emerging affluent customer -earns between $1,000 -$2000 on monthly basis (net) or someone with total relationship with the bank of N5m.\n<h5>Read also:<\/h5>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h5 class=\"entry-post-title\"><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-best-of-2018\/\">The Best of 2018<\/a><\/h5>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<h5 class=\"entry-post-title\"><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/is-ibeju-lekki-nigerias-most-promising-real-estate-location\/\">Is Ibeju Lekki Nigeria’s most promising real estate location?<\/a><\/h5>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThis is essentially the young middle class – one or two children in primary school or just approaching secondary school age looking to own his property, buy a second car, wants to expose his family to the finer things in life – travel, holidays, ivy league schools etc. The offering under the exclusive current account was very limited in addressing the lifestyle needs of this segment of customers.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-40340\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/IV-1-300x226.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"399\" height=\"302\" \/>\n\nSo we, completely revamped the proposition and came up with a service called <em>Xclusive Plus<\/em>. This is a premium service that is available to any customer of the bank that falls into the emerging affluent category. It is a subscription service that will cost you N5,999 a month. (Subscription is easy and takes only a few minutes from when you log unto <a href=\"http:\/\/www.diamondbank\/xclusiveplus\">www.diamondbank\/xclusiveplus<\/a>. And then the fun part begins!\n\nFirst, subscription gets you 5,000 Gem Points. GEM Points is Diamond Bank’s loyalty solution to customers for everyday transactions – you can use them for mundane things like airtime to big ticket items like a fridge.  Diamond Bank has secured partnerships with many merchants which means customers can get discounts on a wide range of services and goods. 5,000 GEM points is definitely not to be sneezed at.\n\nSecond, the subscriber’s debit card also gets upgraded to a Visa Signature Debit Card.  Diamond Bank is the very first bank in Nigeria to go to market with this card. This is a black card with a higher spend limit and it comes with a world of benefits – over 800 premium airport lounges world wide, free travel insurance for baggage loss, medical emergencies are covered for up to $20,000, discounted rates on premium luxury hotels reservations. My personal favourite is the access to a 24-hour concierge service.  Say, you go to Dubai and need tickets for all the tourist attractions or shows.  You don’t need get them yourself. You call the concierge service, who will be the one to book and curate activities for the card holder and send by email, even before you travel or when you are there. Flowers for the wife anywhere in the world? The concierge service can do it for you for free. The card is available for international spend and so holders can spend up to $3,000 per month abroad. It is a Naira card with so many international benefits.\n\nSubscribers also have access to a portal called the <em>Exclusive Channel<\/em>, which has unbelievable gifts and services. The <em>Harvard Business Review<\/em>, <em>Financial Times<\/em>, <em>Businessday<\/em>  can be downloaded without any charge. Subscribers can get free event invites and movie tickets on the channel. So an event like <em>ArtX <\/em>with tickets which cost on average around N10,000 will be available to <em>Xclusive Plus<\/em> subscriber for free!\n\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-40343\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/I.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"335\" height=\"436\" \/>\n\nSo Diamond Bank is helping customers who join the service to reduce their costs of enjoying the lifestyle they want – things they would have spent money on, to live the life they want to live, are available to a N5,999 monthly subscription fee.\n\nOther benefits are discounted rates on mortgages, partnerships with auto dealers to get discounted rates on cars, car loans, heavily subsidised interest rates on personal loans up to N20m.\n\nOur platform has been built such that it is scalable. One new feature that will be included shortly is ‘experience curation’. Say, you are going to a South Africa to experience the jazz scene there.  A jazz specialist in that market will curate the events for you and take you as personal tour guide to experience them. The celebrity lifestyle of our subscribers can only get better!”\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" width=\"330\" height=\"322\" \/><\/a>\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Xclusive Plus Club","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"xclusive-plus-club","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-best-of-2018\/","post_modified":"2019-01-13 21:28:30","post_modified_gmt":"2019-01-13 21:28:30","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=40338","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

It may look like an oversized aquarium, but its ingenious L-shape also provides space for cabinets and equipment. There is also a state-of-the-art feeding system and an advanced filter system. This means that the aquarium only needs to be cleaned and stocked with food once a month.\n\nThe constant movement of the carefully chosen fish makes for a highly restful design.

This is done by keeping a proportion of the rents every year aside as Capital Replacement Reserve.\n\nWhere it is an owner-occupier or estate owned by residents, the norm is to levy themselves (the Owners) to keep a percentage of the service charge as ‘Sinking Fund’ also for this purpose. Apart from replacing capital items, the fund will also be used for large projects like external painting – which we recommend should be done every two years.\n\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\n\nPlanning for the replacement of capital assets means that the estate will keep to the standards when it was first built. Take for instance, the replacement of gym equipment. Equipment like treadmills wear out within two years. If this provision to replace is not made, there’s the high likelihood that only first set of gym equipment will be used and upon breakdown, the equipment will be set aside and the gym turned into aerobic dancing hall or hall for children birthday party or meeting! Make sure that the Capital Assets Register is all encompassing.  ‘Small’ items like pumps for recycling water for swimming pool, taking water from the underground tank to the overhead tank, must be replaced when they get to the end of their useful life, must be included.\n<h3><strong>Power Budget<\/strong><\/h3>\nWe always advise that this is separated from the operational budget. There are many things that impact your power budget that makes it very difficult to plan ahead.\n\nPower has two components – diesel generator power and public supply. For public supply, it is a function of how many hours this is utilised and the tariff structure that applies to the property. Typically, a large property has its own transformer for which a meter- known as the Maximum Demand (MD) meter is attached. Tariff here is typically higher. For budget purposes on a figure for public supply, you usually start at the historical usage and arrive at a projected amount. For example, records show that a particular building enjoyed 30% public supply in the current year – that could be a basis for calculating public supply at 8 hours a day. The tariff is known and the cost can be calculated.\n\nSecond part is the diesel and generator supply. For the generator, there are two components - maintenance and capital cost. The capital cost is usually rejected by tenants; they argue that it is factored into their rent and when the generator packs up, the landlord is to replace it, not them.\n\nFor maintenance, you calculate how many hours we need to run on generator and calculate the diesel consumption. Every generator has the diesel consumption rate per hour. The hours used and the consumption rate will give you the diesel required for the year. You can then take an intelligent projection of the diesel price.\n\nThe prices in the last two years have been fairly stable in the N210 – N230\/ litre range unlike previous years when it has been quite volatile. Here the macro economy comes in: looking at the rising crude oil prices, events in the country etc, you can project that diesel prices will go up to say N250\/litre (Engr Akintunde was quite prescient as a newspaper reported shortly before going to press that diesel rates are in the N250\/litre range).  With these projections, one can arrive at a budgeted rate for public supply costs, diesel costs and maintenance costs.  This will give you the operational budget costs for power.\n\n<strong> <\/strong>\n\n<strong>Conclusion<\/strong>\n\nThe Facilities Management budget is about projected figures. So one must continue to compare actual costs against budgeted figures to get the variance. This can be done on a monthly or quarterly basis. At the end of the year, you may have a deficit to be financed or a surplus to be rolled over.\n\nOne must sound a note of warning. Owners tend to over negotiate budgets down instead of accepting realistic figures.  A pared down budget may look attractive to the landlord\/Investor\/tenants but it means that you are making it more difficult for the Facility Manager to respond adequately to needs that arise during the period.\n\nA number of factors will determine if there is a surplus or deficit at the end of the year but what is certain is that you would have averted many crises because of the proactive nature of the budgeting process.\n\n<strong> <\/strong>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\n\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Budgeting for Facilities Management (2)  ","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"budgeting-for-facilities-management-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-01-14 10:00:56","post_modified_gmt":"2019-01-14 10:00:56","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=40381","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

In the United states, Mr. Donald J Trump cannot stop emphasizing his America first doctrine. Same message seems to be blowing all over Europe. In Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari has directed through Executive Orders that local professionals should be given first priority when companies are engaging service providers in key aspects of the built environment. This columnist cannot claim ignorance to the reasons behind this nationalistic call spreading all over the globe. One of the most important reasons is the rise of unemployment.\n\nUnemployment has been proven to be a time bomb which if not quickly handled, could create instability and breakdown of law and order in any nation. The memories of the Arab spring comes to mind. Nigeria in particular, has a huge unemployment rate. Most of the ethnic killings and crime can easily be attributed to the unengaged youths who have nothing to do. The most political correct and sensible thing to do to curb the surge of unemployment by any sane Government is to create policies that restrict foreigners from snapping such opportunities the indigenous professionals can handle.  However, there has to be a delicate balance when such laws are put in place especially in the real estate sector.\n\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\n\nIn the 70s, key personalities like Alhaji Femi Okunnu SAN ensured that most professionals in the built environment had their professional organisations established and recognised by law which gave them the legal right to practise locally and for the citizenry to patronise their services. In fact, it was made mandatory for such jobs to be done only by a local professional. The Engineering, Architecture and surveying professionals were the biggest beneficiaries of this act. As good as that initial thought was, complacency over the years has caved in which has led to questions being put on the standard and quality of professional services within the whole value chain in the real estate industry, most especially commercial real estate.\n\n<img class=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nia.ng\/mstatus\/block-bg.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for nigeria institute of architects\" width=\"230\" height=\"234\" \/>  <img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/4vector.com\/i\/free-vector-rics-0_078298_rics-0.png\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"244\" height=\"244\" \/>\n\n<img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/theeagleonline.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/COREN-Council-of-Registered-Engineers-of-Nigeria.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"333\" height=\"233\" \/><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.niesv.org.ng\/images\/logo.png\" alt=\"Image result for niesv logo\" width=\"245\" height=\"226\" \/>\n\nUsing the retail commercial segment as an example. In 2005, Mr. Tayo Amusan promoted arguably the first Grade A Mall  in the country. Being the first of its kind in Nigeria, most professionals in the value chain that participated in the development were either expatriates or companies that had some affiliation to a foreign company. In the developed nations and even countries in southern Africa, developments of this nature were common place so it was expected that such expertise would come from such places. The financiers would not even participate in such projects if the right expertise were not used. Come 2018 and we have about 20 of such Grade A malls with a total GLA of 318,208sqm. It is my expectation that over the years, there would have been a concerted effort by professional organisations in the built environment to put in place skills transfer initiatives where the local professionals are able to gain experience and knowledge in the delivery and service provision of such real estate asset classes. In the value chain of any commercial development, you have a series of professionals that are usually involved from inception to completion of such developments-Architects, Engineers.builders, valuers, project managers, facility managers, accountants, lawyers, Quantity surveyors etc. Majority of the professionals working in these organisations are indigenous and have been able to gain useful experience and knowledge in their various disciplines. Why can’t the professional organisations identify these individuals and companies and form a synergy towards skills training and capacity development of the entire membership of the institutions\/organisations. Instead, what I observe is a keen focus on regulation and enforcement of the local laws. Protectionism is what I call it.\n\n<strong>Read also:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p class=\"entry-post-title\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/budgeting-for-facilities-management-2\/\">Budgeting for Facilities Management (2)<\/a>  <\/strong><\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/an-instant-garden-for-christmas\/\">Kitchen Makeover: The Island<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h6>Let me be clear. This columnist is not proposing that the laws should be thrown out of the dustbin and foreign companies allowed to operate uninterrupted. The Government has done its part over the years to put laws to protect the indigenous professionals. The indigenous professional however has a duty to ensure that he is constantly equipped and updated to the modern trends and standards expected in the industry. In a recent visit of the society of Engineers to the Honourable Minister of Works,Power and Housing, Mr.  Babatunde Raji Fashola SAN, the minister was quoted as criticizing the professional leadership in the areas of quality and lacking capacity .In other forums, the minister has castigated almost all professionals in the built environment about the same issues - this includes my profession. As harsh as he might sound, how have the players in the built environment reacted to such comments from the supervising minister of the industry?<\/h6>\nWhy should the commercial real estate segment be accorded more attention by the professional organisations? Among all the asset classes in the real estate industry, commercial office and retail projects bring in the most amount of Foreign direct Investments into the country. This columnist is aware of investment funds running into millions of dollars targeting the commercial retail space. The major drivers are the Private Equity firms who still see Nigeria as a market that has the ability to generate the much-expected yields compared to all other countries. In 2016,a pension fund management company was able to raise $350million for investment in a portfolio of Investments in Nigeria, Zambia and Mozambique. This company has so far built some Grade A mall in the country, one of which gulped a whopping N31.5 Billion along the Lekki-Epe Corridor. In a recent chat with one of the biggest mall promoters in the country, I was informed that they would be ready to engage indigenous professionals in most aspects of their development once they are able to provide the quality and expertise expected. In their words, it’s cheaper to solicit the services of the indigenous professional than bringing in one from overseas. So, a lot of jobs are out there for the indigenous professionals in the built environment. What is therefore needed in my view is to push human capital development to the front burner so that professionals can exploit the great opportunities that lie in the sector.\n\nIn the world today, there is a scramble for investors. In Nigeria, the need for such investment has never been much higher with the sudden downward spike in oil prices and the countries alarming infrastructure deficit. It is therefore not wise to underrate the influence such foreign companies can have in changing Government policies to suit their needs in whichever county they decide to invest. This article is meant to serve as a wakeup call to the leaders in the built environment.\n\n<strong>Olurogba Orimalade FNIVS,FRICS<\/strong>\n\n<strong>Commercial Retail consultant,ROC<\/strong>\n\n<strong>Email:rogba@rogbaorimaladeandco.com<\/strong>\n\n<strong>Tel:+2348033089562<\/strong>\n\n<strong> <\/strong>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\n\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"STANDARDS HAS NO COLOUR","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"standards-has-no-colour","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/budgeting-for-facilities-management-2\/","post_modified":"2019-01-14 10:07:20","post_modified_gmt":"2019-01-14 10:07:20","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=40389","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

As capital allocation is not constrained, real estate as an investment asset class, must compare favourably with other classes of investment. For real estate to compare favourably, it must have a return on investment similar and comparable to other asset classes such as government bonds and company shares; and it must be priced appropriately with consideration given to relevant macro-economic indices in the given jurisdiction.\n\nIn Nigeria, with inflation at c. 11% (and rising) as at August 2018, Monetary Policy Rate \/ Base Rate at 14%; Treasury Bills yield between 10% to 12.6%; FGN bonds yield between 12.8% and 14.69%; and Nigerian Government Eurobonds yielding 7% to 8%, it is exceedingly difficult (if not impossible) for real estate assets yielding between ‘say’ c. 5% and c. 10% to attract investment from retail or institutional investors especially given the alternative investment classes – primarily government securities.\n\n[The justification for investment in real estate (yielding between ‘say’ c. 5% and c. 10%) is capital growth, primarily through rent reviews \/ rent uplifts during the period of investment as opposed to yield compression. Capital growth would aid to give a total return (over the investment period) which could compare favourably with other investment asset classes.]\n\nGiven the above yield differential, it seems to be the case that there exists a structural fault in real estate returns and pricing relative to macro-economic indices in Nigeria.\n\nTo attempt to understand the issue of real estate pricing and, perhaps, the relative lack of institutional investment (other than regulatory limitations such as Regulation on Investment of Pension Fund Assets – April 2017) in Nigerian real estate as an asset class, one must consider the concepts of price, value and worth and view this triumvirate from a real estate perspective.\n\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\n<h4>Price, Value and Worth<\/h4>\nPrice is the amount of money or the consideration that has to be paid to acquire a given product. As long as the amount of money paid for a product represents its value, price is also a measure of value. As said by Warren Buffet, “Price is what you pay; value is what you get.” It follows therefore that price should not be too dissimilar from value – certainly, one should be within a reasonable margin of the other. After all, a purchaser does not want to pay a price that far exceeds value nor would a seller want to receive a price far lower than value.\n\nTheoretically, market price is the amount at which one transacts on an asset while market value is the true underlying value of an asset. The difference between price and value is usually as a result of inefficient markets i.e. lack of information, or situations where prevailing market prices are not reflective of true underlying market value. For market price to equal market value, the market must be efficient from an information perspective and rational expectations must prevail. One could conclude that price would hardly equal value as markets are not efficient and rational.\n\n<strong>Read also:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-best-of-2018\/\">The Best of 2018<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/fcmb-premium-banking\/\">FCMB Premium Banking<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\nFrom a real estate perspective, open market value (OMV) or value, according to International Valuation Standards is “the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently, and without compulsion”.\n\nOpen Market Value determination or property valuation based on yield implies that the value of an asset is the net annual income from the asset multiplied by the inverse of the yield (where yield is the annualised return from the asset expressed as a percentage). Therefore, an asset with a yield of ‘say’ 5% would have its net annual rental income multiplied by 20 while an asset with a yield of ‘say’ 9% would have its annual income multiplied by 11.11 to determine its open market value. As well as yield, property valuation is also based on comparable evidence from the market.\n\nIn finance, the value of an asset could be considered to be the lump sum payment made (today) for the benefit of the future cash flow accruing from the asset. This is essentially the DCF method of valuation.\n\nGiven that price is the amount that one transacts on an asset, and it can be established as a matter of fact from market evidence, it follows that price would be equal to value as described above once a transaction completes. This gives objectivity and acceptance to both price and value.\n\nWorth, whilst used, unfortunately, interchangeably with price and \/ or value, should not be mistaken for price or value. Worth is a subjective view of price or value; and it is the price or value to a particular entity or individual as opposed to the market.\n\nFor example, an asset (‘say’ office premises) next to a manufacturing plant could be worth more to the owners of the manufacturing plant due to its proximity to the plant. The same asset would not be worth so much to any other tenant or potential owner. In this example, the worth to the owners of the manufacturing plant exceeds the value of the asset in the market.\n\nSimilarly, due to the legal, planning and construction challenges faced by a residential developer, residential units developed on a (perhaps inherited) parcel of land could be considered to be worth a lot more than a willing buyer would pay. The worth ascribed to the asset should not be determined to be the value of the asset.\n\nWith price, value and worth broadly understood, consideration should be given to capital and cost of capital used to acquire real estate.\n<h4>Cost of Capital<\/h4>\nAll capital, debt or equity, has a cost, with debt generally considered cheaper than equity.\n\nIn any (investment) market, debt (and cost of debt) is a vital element, which serves to, inter alia, improve return on (equity) investment.\n\nIn broad terms, the start point for the cost of debt is to determine the risk-free rate, which is the rate at which sovereign entities i.e. governments borrow, then add a risk premium for borrower risk and investment risk. In Nigeria, the Nigerian Naira risk-free rate would be the yield on Treasury Bills (10% to 12.6%), or for long term borrowing, the yield on 5-year or 10-year bonds (12.8% to 14.69%) whilst the United States Dollar risk-free rate would be Nigerian Government Eurobonds (7% to 8%). Borrower risk and investment risk could be upwards of 2% depending on a host of considerations. Assuming a total (borrower and investment) risk premium of c. 2% or 3%, then the cost of long term debt should be no less than c. 15% or 16% in Nigerian Naira and c. 9% or\n\n10% in United States Dollar.\n\nConsidering central government securities (treasury bills, bonds) are considered risk-free and other investment asset classes are priced (with a risk premium) relative to the risk-free rate, then no asset class should be priced or yield a (total) return lower than the risk-free rate……..unless the investment is seen and accepted to be more secure or less risky than sovereign \/ government securities.\n\nReal estate investment is certainly not considered to be more secure \/ less risky than government securities even with a very good quality tenant in occupation on a long lease.\n\nIn addition, to the extent that debt (priced as explained above) is utilised in the acquisition of real estate investment, then the real estate investment must have total return in excess of the cost of debt i.e. a yield in excess of c. 15% or 16% in Nigerian Naira and in excess of c. 9% or 10% in United States Dollars to service the debt; and capital growth to compensate for the risk of investment.\n\nOtherwise, the investment total return would not suffice to service the interest on the debt never mind amortise the debt and compensate investor.\n\nNote: It is possible, and there could be significant value in buying an asset at an initial yield lower than the cost of debt if the purchaser believes that a reversionary yield in excess of the initial yield can be achieved. The reason for this is likely to be that a rent review is imminent or the asset has high vacancy.\n\nThe value in a transaction of this nature would be the purchaser’s ability to maximise annual rent at rent review, or minimise vacancy within the asset in the shortest possible time or both. In any event, the purchaser’s key initial objective would be to achieve reversionary yield (in excess of cost of debt) as soon as practically possible.\n<h4>Back to Value<\/h4>\nOnly when real estate yields (initial and reversionary) are in the range suggested above would real estate as an investment asset class be attractive to retail and institutional investors when compared against other investment asset classes.\n\nWhen considered from this perspective, the logical conclusion is that real estate assets, with initial yields of c. 5% to c. 9% (i.e. multiples of c. 11 to 20) on Nigerian Naira net annual income, are significantly over-valued especially in the absence of real capital growth and reversionary yield to support an attractive total return (which is not based on yield compression).\n\nWith real estate yields as explained and determined above, multiples on Nigerian Naira net annual income from real estate should be in the range of 6.90 (c. 14.5% yield) to 6.25 (16% yield) in the absence of real capital growth to derive a total return in excess of cost of debt.\n\nThe yield could reduce slightly in a market with a deep tenant pool (therefore low vacancy rates) and stable currency.\n\nFor completeness, real capital growth is based, largely, on increases in rental income over and above prevailing inflation during the hold period of the investment. An asset bought and sold at the same yield but with the benefit of rental income growth over and above prevailing inflation would have the benefit of capital growth and would be likely to derive a positive total return.\n\nThe above suggests that real estate asset with a net income of ‘say’ NGN 5 million per annum currently valued and priced at c. NGN 83.33 million based on a yield of 6% is significantly over-valued and should, perhaps, be more appropriately valued and priced at c. NGN 35.5 million based on a yield of 14.5% especially if a rent review is not imminent and real capital growth is not certain.\n\nOver-valuation is one of the reasons real estate financiers are often asked by agnostic investors: ‘why invest in real estate for a yield of x% (without certainty of real capital growth) when an investment in government securities can be made for a yield of 1.5x% or 2x%?\n\nWhilst it could be argued that any difference between price and value of an asset is down to demand and supply and market inefficiency, price, we know, would equal value at transaction completion. The issue of worth, and trying to equate worth to value or price, should not occur nor should it be permitted in any market.\n\nFor prudent and competent real estate pricing, consideration should be given to whether an investor \/ a purchaser would be willing to acquire an asset that yields a total return that is far less than the cost of capital and if, indeed, the cost of capital has been considered, determined and understood.\n\nShould an investor or purchaser be willing to accept a total return less than cost of capital, then, it seems value creation is not the objective of investment and, perhaps, the source of the capital ought to be questioned.\n\nIn order to create value within the real estate industry in Nigeria, it is incumbent on all participants in the sector to consider international best practices in real estate asset valuation and pricing and ensure that overvaluation \/ unjustifiable pricing (based on worth) is avoided.\n\nWritten by Adenekan ADENIRAN, Principal at FRISIA Partners (www.frisiapartners.com)\n\nAbout FRISIA:\n\nFRISIA Partners is a transaction advisory and consulting services firm with a focus on the real estate sector in emerging and frontier markets.

But it can be difficult to know where to start. So this article aims to help point out a few of the things a London Landlord needs to know. It’s important to note that in the U.K, the responsibility of a tenant having an enjoyable stay in a property rests on the landlord. So, as a result of this, there are certain statutory requirements of a landlord. These statutory requirements include but aren’t limited to appliances and structural wear and tear.\n\nOne of the greatest and most critical appliance cost come in the boiler. A white box, usually little bigger than a mini fridge, but all so important. Boilers are crucial both for heating and hot water and as such is top of the most critical requirements of tenants. Repairs to boilers must happen within a reasonable time frame and can’t be simply at the whim of the landlord. The expected time envelope of response for boiler related issues typically 24 - 48 hours. This is especially daunting during the winter season where the resultant cold - with sub-zero temperatures - leads to the cost of replacing a boiler becoming astronomical. Depending on the rent the property attracts, this can take out the equivalent of a year's rental margin - profit made on the rent - or the entire rent even. Annual gas safety checks are also required on the boilers.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/landlord-maintenance-tips\/thumbnail\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-40403\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-40403\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/thumbnail-300x130.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"499\" height=\"218\" \/><\/a>\n\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\n\n<strong>Read also: <\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p class=\"entry-post-title\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/budgeting-for-facilities-management-2\/\">Budgeting for Facilities Management (2)  <\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p class=\"entry-post-title\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/is-ibeju-lekki-nigerias-most-promising-real-estate-location\/\">Is Ibeju Lekki Nigeria’s most promising real estate location?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nLandlords also have to keep well abreast of changes in regulation, health, and safety. With regards to Fires and flammable items, the landlord needs to ensure that the furniture in the property is generally fire resistant and that Fire alarms are installed in the property and working. The criticality of such things horrendously observed in the Grenfell disaster, where a fire from a faulty unit caused untold damage to lives and property building-wide. This is thus particularly important for those who own multiple units in a house or even a flat in a block. From 1st of October 2015, it became compulsory to have smoke alarms on every storey of a property. For flats or houses in single family occupation, all properties must now have a long-life or mains-powered smoke alarm system throughout, along with a carbon monoxide alarm in all high-risk rooms. The requirements are more demanding for HMOs (House of Multiple Occupancy). These alarms must be checked at the start of each tenancy and the fine for going afoul of this can go up to £5,000\n\nApart from the danger, the fire poses to the occupant of the building. The property itself could suffer significant damage and not having it may impact the insurance claim. There is also a similar requirement for Carbon Dioxide alarms, however, this wouldn’t apply to most new build properties. You should also conduct a fire risk assessment for each of your properties. Best practice dictates that you should keep a written copy of this assessment for future reference. With most of the above mentioned, most of your responsibilities are restricted to the apartment, but if its a freehold house, the responsibility might include communal areas and public areas as well.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/landlord-maintenance-tips\/thumbnail-1\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-40404\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-40404\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/thumbnail-1-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"390\" height=\"390\" \/><\/a>\n\nAs well as proper checks at the beginning and end of a tenancy, you should arrange to make inspections of the property at regular intervals. By keeping an eye on problems as they arise, you can make sure you head them off quickly. Before a new tenant arrives, make sure that you provide them with an information pack that sets out the basic things they should do in order to prevent damage to the property. For example, make sure that they know to air the property regularly and ensure that it is kept properly heated in colder months in order to minimize mold. Many tenants, especially those who have recently begun renting, are not aware of the simple things they need to do in order to keep the property running, but you can avoid problems by making sure that you educate them from the outset.\n\nDon’t ignore problems – they will only get worse. If a tenant reports a fault, or if you notice one during an inspection, make sure that you fix it immediately. A simple problem, if left unattended to, can quickly grow into a potentially expensive disaster. Make sure that you pay particular attention to the property during the winter months, as this is the time during which many of the most damaging problems can arise.\n\nIts the landlord's responsibility to ensure that they are applying the relevant legislation correctly. Ignorance of legislation doesn’t offer sufficient protection. We feel that these are some of the advantages of using a managing agent, it’s their duty and responsibilities to always keep an eye on relevant legislation and to ensure all your properties are compliant. You might be able to save some money by going the DIY route, but if you hire an agent to do it for you, you could save your own valuable time, especially as an international landlord.\n\nFor a no fee, no obligation chat on the different statutory requirements of London Landlord.

The stepping pads were placed in the artificial turf for functional use of the gardener and also to break up the mass of the turf. Pebbles of different hues and sizes were used to differentiate the sections of the garden. Easily manageable plants like succulents and cacti were planted for convenience but they also work very well as ‘eye candy’. The beauty of this garden is that one can work around existing plants like the  tree in this case or even structural elements.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/an-instant-garden-for-christmas-2\/i-4\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-40449\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-40449\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/I-2-300x162.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"558\" height=\"302\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/an-instant-garden-for-christmas-2\/iv-4\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-40450\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-40450\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/IV-3-300x208.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/an-instant-garden-for-christmas-2\/iii-5\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-40451\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-40451\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/III-3-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" height=\"193\" \/><\/a>\n\nThis garden in the  United States was the inspiration for the minimalist garden in Lekki.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\n\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"An instant garden for Christmas","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"an-instant-garden-for-christmas-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-01-14 17:37:03","post_modified_gmt":"2019-01-14 17:37:03","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=40409","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},
{"ID":"40455","post_author":"18","post_date":"2019-01-14 17:54:13","post_date_gmt":"2019-01-14 17:54:13","post_content":"<strong> PROPERTY INVESTMENT<\/strong>\n\n<strong>Follow the money: A real estate investment guide for Landlords in 2019<\/strong>\n\nDescribing the Ikoyi property as a house would be pushing the definition of ‘house’. The roof had caved in, the wooden stairs rotted away, kitchen was non-existent, the garden was a jungle and there were no functional windows. “But it is structurally sound” was the Landlord’s cheerful response as he placed an offer of $175,000 per annum rent, payable five years in advance to the potential tenants. The representatives of the tenant - a bank, made a counter offer. They wanted a lease for 15 years at the same rent. Eventually, it was agreed that a five-year advance of the rent ($175,000 per annum) would be paid with rent revision clauses for the next ten years.\n\nThis fairy tale, happily ever after story took place in 1996. Today, the Landlord is offering the property albeit now well renovated, for N20m but can ‘come down to N15m’. Payment terms include this clause: 1 year rent is acceptable. This means that using the exchange rate of N360 - $1, the landlord is effectively ready to accept $41,666 rent for the property, compared to $175,000, twenty-three years ago.\n\nWhy this turn of events? Those negotiating for the bank (now defunct) in 1996, knew that, as they were discussing with the Landlord, he was also fielding comparative offers from multi-national companies, Embassies, International Oil Companies (IOCs) and local financial institutions. This level of demand meant that the landlord could charge a premium over the going rates, even for a decrepit building. An Ikoyi residential address was considered essential for the Managing Director of the bank to compete with his peers in the financial sector. But by 2018, the situation had changed drastically. Demand for property in the high-end locations has weakened significantly. The banking reforms had pruned the number of the banks, oil prices meant that the IOCs had cut back on staff and therefore housing, while Embassies had relocated to Abuja over the period.\n\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\n\nSo while it is true that there is an oversupply of properties in the high-end markets heightening competition, the drying up of demand is also a major factor landlords have to consider in current times.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/follow-the-money\/v-4\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-40457\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-40457\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/V-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"260\" height=\"263\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/follow-the-money\/i-5\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-40456\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-40456\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/I-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"293\" height=\"197\" \/><\/a>\n\nThis is not only the case in the residential property segment. In its <em>2019 Nigeria Real Estate Market Outlook<\/em>, Northcourt, a real estate investment solutions company explained that in the shopping malls, “Grade A retail rents are now paid in local currency as opposed to the erstwhile favourite – the US Dollar and payable monthly in some instances (as opposed to annually\/multi-year).” What started as incentives occasioned by the 2017 recession is now the norm.\n\nIn its <em>OFFICE MARKET <\/em><em> <\/em><em>VIEWPOINT<\/em>  Q3: 2018, Broll observed  ‘Market practices that have become the norm (rent free periods, tenant improvement allowances, extended BO periods, etc.) have persisted amongst prime-grade landlords. In a bid to drive occupancy levels, competitive leasing terms which are favourable to tenants were noted in Q3:2018.\n\nThe median average asking rent for A-grade offices in Ikoyi has remained constant at US$750\/m2\/annum in Q3:2018. In the Victoria Island commercial node, the median average asking rent has also remained fairly constant at US$650\/m2\/annum.  Vacancy rates in A-grade buildings are currently around 76% and 56% in Ikoyi and Victoria Island respectively.’\n\nThe point must however be made that demand has not dried up completely. Indeed, in some real estate segments like co-working spaces, demand is rising. In 2019, the landlord must work out where the demand is and position their offerings appropriately.\n\n<strong>Read also:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p class=\"entry-post-title\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/an-instant-garden-for-christmas-2\/?preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=40452\">An instant garden for Christmas<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p class=\"entry-post-title\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/landlord-maintenance-tips\/\">Landlord Maintenance Tips<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>Should the property be re-configured?<\/strong>\n\nA landlord of a 5 bedroom semi detached house in Lekki Phase 1 had been looking for a tenant for his property for over two years. Based on the comment of his 30 year old niece that she would gladly take the property if she had two people to share it with, he reconfigured the property into two nos 2 bedroom flats and the servants quarters into a chalet. He was able to let the flats for N2m each and the chalet for N1.2m bringing his total rent to N5.2m. This was compared to the N4m he was prepared to take for the entire property let as a whole. It is this type of space reconfiguration that has been applied to commercial office blocks in the form of Collaborative work-spaces (co- working) According to Wikipedia, <strong>Coworking<\/strong> involves a shared workplace, often an office, and independent activity. Unlike in a typical office, those <strong>coworking<\/strong> are usually not employed by the same organization. So instead of landlords of commercial office blocks, looking for one or a small number of  corporates to take up long term leases of  spaces in their property, they have reconfigured the property to take a larger number of small businesses. This is where the demand is. According to a report by the Brol Property Group – <em>Co-working: Trends and  outlook in the Lagos Office market<\/em>,  this is a fast growing segment of the market. “In Lagos, we see the global co-working trend through a varied number of local service providers operating in the market. With over 50 local co-working operators, Regus is the only international brand operating under a direct franchise model in the market. Nigeria has a strong entrepreneurial culture as cataloged in the <em>Global Start-up Ecosystem 2017 Report<\/em>, which valued the Lagos startup ecosystem the highest in Africa with a growth index of 6.6. As these start-ups continue to spring up, we see a stronger demand for co-working real estate solutions. “\n\n<strong>Should the use be changed? <\/strong>\n\nLagos is evolving rapidly and the character of many neighbourhoods can change. It appears overnight but astute watchers of a location can see the trend well before it becomes the norm. For instance, for over eight years, <em>Castles Lifestyle <\/em>has been reporting on the commercialization of Lekki Phase 1. The precedent was clear: this was how Victoria Island moved from being primarily residential to overwhelmingly commercial. The reason for the movement of corporates to Lekki Phase 1 is obvious: it is about 40 – 50% cheaper than renting office space, and with the Lekki Link Bridge, it is also very assessable. Forward-looking landlords have already converted their properties on the ‘high streets’ of Fola Osibo, Admiralty Way, Admiralty Road etc to shopping malls. Others are joining in but they have missed the first wave and will have to contend with fierce competition. Owners of shopping malls are also changing their models to focus on revenue generating areas like parking food courts, play areas and cinemas.\n\n<strong>Facility management: service or self-service? <\/strong>\n\nA new lexicon has entered the real estate dictionary – ‘self-service. It refers to a multi-tenanted property where the landlord does not provide all or any facility management services. A landlord of a townhouse mini-estate in Oniru found to his chagrin that it was until he removed the generator as part of the services to be charged for that he was able to let the apartments fully. His tenants, mainly families, had their own generators and inverters and were not ready to pay the service charge for alternative power generation.  In some other apartment blocks, even in highbrow Ikoyi, tenants have negotiated with the landlords to limit the alternative power supply to reduce the Service Charge. Landlords have to judge the appetite of the prospective tenants for top facility services – if the tenants don’t want them or are not prepared to pay for them, then those services are a turn off and not an attraction. We have seen a number of adverts styling properties as ‘Self Service’ to indicate that there is a demand for such properties.\n\n<strong>The Short-lets\/Air bnb  model. <\/strong>\n\nBy now the trend is becoming clear. If your property cannot be let in the conventional fashion, then consider other altering the offering to attract another type of tenant. One of these options is the short let model. Again, this depends on the location, style and layout of the property and the amount of work the Landlord is prepared to do make this model a success.  However, with the right property, plugging into the Air bnb network means that most of the work has been done for the landlord.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/follow-the-money\/iii-6\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-40459\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-40459\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/III-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"262\" height=\"180\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/follow-the-money\/iv-5\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-40458\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-40458\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/IV-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"296\" height=\"136\" \/><\/a>\n\nVoid periods is a recent phenomenon brought about by changes in the real estate landscape. The conventional tenants have disappeared. To get their properties yielding a fair return, landlords have to ‘follow the money’. Who has rent money to spend and what do they want to spend it on? It then lies on the landlord to ensure their properties meet the criteria of these prospective tenants. If not, their money will go to another property.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\n\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Follow the money","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"follow-the-money","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/landlord-maintenance-tips\/","post_modified":"2019-01-14 17:54:28","post_modified_gmt":"2019-01-14 17:54:28","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=40455","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

But this issue of <em>yahoo <\/em>boys using panties to ‘determine the destiny’ of a woman is tasking my skills, experience and patience!\r\n\r\nOne of the blocks of flats I manage is on 4 floors in Oniru Estate in Lagos. There are two flats on each floor making it a total of 8 flats. 6 of the flats are rented by families and the two top most flats are rented by single professional women. The tenants usually get along, although they are not close and I never had issues with them. The rents and service charge gets paid on time and communal facilities like the clothes line, dustbins etc  are used with mutual respect. All this was going on smoothly, until last week.\r\n\r\nIt all started when I got a call from the Landlord. He had received an anonymous tip that clothes were being spread on the veranda of some of the flats. This was against the rules and he wanted me to check. Later that day, I went to the property and was amazed to see that all the flats had clothes spread on the balconies. All except one – the flat of the Chukwus. I immediately came to the conclusion that, this was where the anonymous tip had come from.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs it was against the rules and was expressly stated in the Tenancy Agreements, I immediately wrote to all the tenants, stating that the practice should be discontinued. The response to the email was immediate.  If they could not spread their clothes on the balconies of their flats, they would move at the end of their lease. The two professional women on the top flats actually threatened to move immediately.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRead also:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/invitation-for-bids-by-federal-university-lokoja\/\">Invitation For Bids by Federal University Lokoja<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/get-the-look-gardens\/\">Get The Look: Gardens<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat could be the cause of all this? I asked the security man, as these people usually know all the goings on in a compound. Turns out that, as a security measure for ‘protecting their destinies’, the women in the compound had started spreading their underwear on the balconies. What about the Chukwus? Turns out that Mrs Chukwu has a washing machine and dryer installed for this purpose. Where could the tip have come from? Mrs. Chukwu. She was threatened by the fact that her husband will be seeing such exotic panties and undergarments and make him start having ideas about the other women in the compound.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do about this situation? The Landlord is adamant that clothes should not be spread on balconies but if the tenants  go it will be very difficult to get new tenants. That means my Management fees will not be paid for a while. 2019 has not taken off on a good note!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/tenant-tales\/tenant-tales\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-43764\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-43764\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/tenant-tales-300x155.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"491\" height=\"254\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" width=\"359\" height=\"351\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Tenant Tales","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"tenant-tales","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-01-27 07:55:59","post_modified_gmt":"2019-01-27 07:55:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=43763","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

Of course, everyone wants the best but if you don’t want to end up with a half finished building without knowing how to complete it, then a practical approach is needed.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to determine before briefing your architect is to assess how long you expect the project to take and how much you can raise during that period. It is this amount that you can raise (including borrowing) that should guide your next decisions. If the amount you can raise is too small, then extend the period of construction by dividing the project into phases. For example, phase 1 could be foundation, Phase 2 for ground floor block-work up to decking and so on.\r\n\r\nDuring the project design briefing, go to town with your ‘wish list’ but also add the amount you can raise. The two major cost models relative to the project design are; Cost to design (CTD) and Design to Cost (DTC). Cost to design simply means putting up a design first and then estimating the total construction cost from the design usually without tying it to any budget while Design to cost entails stating your budget for the project first, then ensuring that the project is designed to be completed within that budget.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\nEngr. Osaz’ ENOBAKHARE explains the concept:  For instance using the recommended DTC model, a project owner can approach a designer\/contractor with say 4 Million Naira to construct a simple bungalow and achieve his\/her desires within it in the following simple steps;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>First, you discuss the development idea\/concept with the designer\/contractor,<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Thereafter you reveal your initial budget, say 3.5 Million Naira and retain the balance,<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Then request that the designer\/contractor provide two or three design options that can be achieved within your budget and based on your specifications (e.g. It should consist of 3 beds -all rooms en-suite, French-style windows, an ante-room, slanting height, a court yard etc). However it is strongly recommended that you employ the service of a designer\/contractor with good knowledge of both design, estimation and construction from the start as it is in common knowledge that most independent designers\/architects aren’t good estimators or alternatively you co-engage a Quantity Surveyor to achieve your cost goal (You will have to pay for this service say around 5% of the total project cost).<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Once the preliminary site investigation is completed and the building designs and cost estimates are ready, you then choose the most appealing design. Do not hesitate to pre-inform the estimator\/contractor to simplify the cost estimates by breaking it into two main sections one showing the Material cost\/schedule and the other, the labour cost\/schedule (which will include the contractor’s profit so that it can be negotiated separately). You have to study the estimates carefully and compare for consistency with the design.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Because some features would have been deliberately excluded in the design in order to make it fit into the cost plan, you may have to add some much desired features (like special finishes, fittings and fixtures, etc) within your initial retention budget (in this case, the 500,000 NGN left). But don’t use all of it; keep a fraction for contingencies, and<\/li>\r\n \t<li>You are good to go.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Read also:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/tenant-tales\/\">Tenant tales<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/tenders-supply-of-goods-and-services-by-fct-admin\/\">Tenders! Supply of Goods and Services by FCT Admin<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHowever in the Cost-to-Design model, the project owner\/landlord is highly disadvantaged in that the designer\/contractor may come up with fabulous designs that may be far beyond your budget because there have been little or no consideration of the cost implication of the design at the initial stage.  This is the most common case in practice. When this happens, subsequently the project owner lured to this expensive design begins to run helter-skelter to source for additional funds to complete the project and this is not usually a funny experience.\r\n\r\nThink carefully and make the right choice of cost model to adopt for your next building project.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/dont-make-your-building-project-a-white-elephant\/calc\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-43768\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-43768\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/calc-300x141.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"638\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Don’t make your building project a white elephant","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"dont-make-your-building-project-a-white-elephant","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/tenant-tales\/","post_modified":"2019-01-27 07:51:25","post_modified_gmt":"2019-01-27 07:51:25","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=43767","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

These days, a lot of people in Lagos opt for a home with a modern touch, adorned with contemporary decor elements that propel the home character, giving it a grand demeanour. More people are abandoning the plaid and floral sofa, heavy drapery and 50’s style decorating into the new, clean and bold.\r\n\r\nThe Tango unit is a reflection of the urban taste trend which captures the essence of city living with youthful flair and pace. The spaces are awash with au courant decor pieces, giving a distinct character to this lovely 2-bedroom home.

This finding was the result of an informal poll of 45 respondents, which was carried out by Castles Lifestyle in January 2019.  The higher the rent and service charge, the more exacting the expectations of the respondents the result of the poll seems to suggest.  So a Facility Manager who is running the services of the property efficiently but does not respond to enquiries promptly may be considered as ‘below par’.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b><\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe competition in the luxury flat rental market has become very fierce in recent times as more units are placed in the market while the pool of prospective tenants has been shrinking. Landlords have reacted by cutting down rents and accepting Naira rents as opposed to dollars. They have also reacted by providing even more recreational facilities – squash &amp; tennis courts etc to attract tenants. But the results of the poll show that they must also keep a very close eye on he facility management side.  After rental amount, facility management comes a close second on the wish-list of tenants in this segment. They are very interested in how this service is provided and conduct independent research to confirm what the agents are telling them during the search. <u>The Service Charge is not considered independent of rent – the present day tenants view both as their total outlay on the property and this influences their decision<\/u>.  The result is, in some apartments, the service charge is as high as 60% of the rent because the tenants demand a high standard of facility management while maintaining a fixed amount of what they want to pay. So rental income suffers as the Landlord is forced to back down or continue to face a void period. The pressure then shifts to the Facility Manager as tenants adopt a ‘take no prisoner’ approach to standard of services received. Because Tenants now pay yearly instead of being  locked into contracts for two years or more, they are more mobile and increasing vote with their feet by moving apartments at the end of the term.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_48336\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"596\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-facility-management-advantage\/pi\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-48336\"><img class=\" wp-image-48336\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/PI-300x246.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"596\" height=\"488\" \/><\/a> Angry tenants are more likely to move due to poor facility management[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Read also:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/kings-towers-ikoyi\/\">Kings Tower, Ikoyi<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/2-bedroom-apartment-design-scheme-1\/\">2 Bedroom Apartment – Design Scheme 1<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Self-Service<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe impact of facility management charges has also been felt in the upper middle class locations of Lekki Phase 1 and Oniru. Here Landlords faced with tenants’ resistance to paying facility management fees have resorted to limited services tagged ‘self-service’. Here expensive services like 24\/7 power are scrapped with the tenants, even those in multi-tenanted apartments’ making provision for their own power. “It’s not a tidy arrangement”, Castles Lifestyle was told by an agent running an apartment block on those terms “but we find that if we add power into the service  charge mix, the value goes up significantly and a fair number of tenants renting in these locations are not prepared to meet that cost. They already have their own generators and inverters and want to run these according to their own pockets and not a communally defined arrangement. It is not very tidy but we have to move according to market sentiment.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIndeed, landlords and property investors have to be more responsive in their approach to property management as the real estate market in these segments is more of a buyers market.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"463\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b><\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"The Facility Management Advantage","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"the-facility-management-advantage","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/kings-towers-ikoyi\/","post_modified":"2019-02-22 09:54:25","post_modified_gmt":"2019-02-22 09:54:25","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=48335","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

At N300, 000 per annum, he knew from <em>Castles Lifestyle<\/em> that the rent in that location was easily over a million Naira. The deal made him throw caution to the wind: he did not even tell his Pastor to pray about it, which was his custom when making serious decisions. Even the altercation between the agent and one of the occupants during the inspection did not faze him. The man had asked the agent why “leading the sheep to the slaughter.”\r\n\r\nHis major concern was the economics of getting the studio flat. First, the flat was incredibly cheap even cheaper than the one he was renting in Egbeda. Another plus was the high calibre tenants he would be mingling with. He was sure that the connections would stand him in good stead in the future. The icing on the cake was the savings he would make in transport fare to his office in Victoria Island. He moved his wedding plans by several months just thinking about the situation.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b><\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHowever, the first night he spent in his dream apartment was not a good dream. He had a horrible nightmare. He woke up that morning drenched in sweat but could not remember what the dream was all about. His only recollection was a woman’s voice, repeatedly saying “why nah? Why nah? Why nah?” He put it out of his mind and decided that that he will make conscious effort to meet his top class neighbours as they set out for work. His greeting however evoked funny stares, which he put down to snobbish behaviour.\r\n\r\n<strong>Read also:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-facility-management-advantage\/\">The Facility Management Advantage<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/get-the-look-gardens\/\">Get The Look: Gardens<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Why nah? Why nah? why nah?” the haunting voice was his constant companion all night. He decided that he would invite his Pastor to pray with him in the place. The next morning, he was accosted by a neighbour who narrated the story that scared him. Apparently a young girl who had lived in that flat was murdered 3 years ago. The neighbours found the heart of the young lady hacked into pieces in flat. It was suspected that her boyfriend was responsible for the murder but was never proven. Before Bayo packed into the flat about 3 men that rented the place had to quit. Each with the same complaint of the sound at night. Another tenant who heard the tail end of the conversation laughed it off. He said that there was a tree beside the apartment which gave that kind of sound when the wind blew through its leaves. Bayo was not even listening to what the man said – he had just realised that he was in a discussion with two General Managers of new generation banks! By now both men had realised it was getting late and left with a promise to call Bayo that night when they returned. Bayo was in seventh heaven as he left to his office. He was already making top connections! But what about this ghost business? He called his Pastor to pray there with him that night. If the Man of God did not pick up any signals, all was well and the explanation of the second tenant was probably correct. That night, the pastor came, prayed and anointed the flat. The pastor prophesied that he would ‘prosper’ in this place. Bayo shook off the suspicion that his Pastor was more interested in the connections he too could make from the other neighbours rather than spiritual warfare. That night, the sound (blood speaking?) came again. Was this a warning or was there a scientific explanation for this?

The Green House in Guzape, Abuja ticks all these boxes. How did the developers achieve this?<\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe Green House is a ‘mini estate’ of 10 units of semi-detached houses in the Guzape District of Abuja. There is nothing in its exterior to suggest that it is different from any of the other developments around it. But it is extremely different from all other buildings in Nigeria.  The residents have been enjoying continuous power supply since May 2015…..without connection to the grid or generators!\r\n\r\nThe firm responsible for this ‘miracle’ is Nigeria-based backup and renewable energy firm, Blue Camel Energy Ltd. To be able to achieve this, they had to take over the design, construction and overall maintenance of the apartment block.\r\n\r\nThe design and construction was driven by the need to minimize the energy consumption of the residents. The building’s layout is such as to foster adequate ventilation to flow through each unit, reducing the need to run the air conditioning (AC) units. The roof is made of concrete slabs, which minimizes heat penetration into the building.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b><\/b>\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the residents use energy efficiently, each apartment comes semi-furnished with eco-friendly refrigeration units, \u2028air conditioners and television sets that are power efficient. The external perimeter, garden and security lighting systems \u2028run independently.  The fridges and freezers are connected to a timer to maximise energy savings, running for an average of 10 hours a day. The AC units do not have starting current or surge current and they consume approximately 30% less energy than a regular AC system. The installed water tank system has the capacity to supply 57,000 litres of water, while 2,250 litres is the solar thermal capacity at any one time.\r\n\r\n<strong>Read also:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/narrow-is-the-way\/\">Narrow is the way…..<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/2-bedroom-apartment-design-scheme-1\/\">2 Bedroom Apartment – Design Scheme 1<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEnergy is provided by 10 wind turbines and 148 solar panels – 15kW of wind and 45kW of solar photovoltaic (PV) – enabling the development to run completely off renewable power. 12 units of 200Ah AGM deep cycle batteries back up every sub-unit within the property.

This is an often under thought question but is a fundamental consideration in your property investment strategy. Your ultimate aim as an investor is to maximize the returns on your capital, be it by the rental yield from the property, or the capital appreciation that can be gotten by a rise in prices. As such you want to pay attention to things that affect either of those factors before and during your ownership of your property asset.\r\n\r\nA big headache for Landlords besides problem tenants, which we’ll cover in a separate article, is void periods. It is not the ideal place to be for a Landlord to have a unit that isn’t generating any income or sitting fallow, especially if there is a mortgage on the property, or the landlord is at a point of their career or business life, where it is harder to cover any void periods out of their active income. With this backdrop in mind, it is favored to get a Long term tenant, either by happenstance i.e frequent renewals or by contract from the onset.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b><\/b>\r\n\r\nTypically, there are two ways you get a Long term tenant, as mentioned above, either from someone who extends their contract at expiration for another term, or someone who would like to bed down in an area for a longer period requests a long term contract from the onset. The typical length of a tenancy agreement in England is one year, with a break clause after 6 months for either of the parties to terminate the contract. However, it is also possible for a tenant to request a 3-year contract for instance, which would come with an agreed break clause. Some long term tenants prefer the Annual renewal of their tenancies as it gives implied flexibility and are happy to renew annually for as many as 11 years In some cases.\r\n\r\nThere are strong advantages to having a long term tenant, with the first one being financial security. A long term tenant guarantees a stable rent and fewer void periods around tenancy renewal periods. This saves you the landlord the inconvenience of sitting on a costly empty property and is also beside the fact that when you’re sitting on an empty property, you’re still liable for council tax on the unit.  Long term tenants also tend to be reliable - they would have been evicted or eased out if they weren’t - and by extension tend to look after your property better, since they see it as their own. This conversely means there are fewer repairs to be carried out in your property, thus protecting your income.\r\n\r\n<strong>Read also:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel\/\">‘Light’ at the end of the tunnel?<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/can-blood-speak-2\/\">Can Blood Speak?<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are also shortcomings with long term tenants though, Firstly if it’s a long term contract option, there is always the risk that the tenants' life circumstances may change and leave you with a sudden and unexpected break in income, changes such as loss of job, death etc. Also, the tenants can come to believe they own the property and drag their feet when it comes to leaving. This may not seem like a big concern but can become problematic if you need to sell the property vacant. The biggest problem with long term tenants, however, is that rent stagnates over time. Rent increases by an average of 2.6% per annum in London, what this means is that if you have a long term tenant over ten years, you may lose out on 26% of rental yield growth over that period. At an annual rental yield of £20,000, that would equal roughly £52,000 of lost income over ten years.\r\n\r\nPeople choose Long term rental for different reasons such as its proximity to work or good schools. They may even be seeking some stability for their young family for a while whilst also building up their savings. We once had a tenant in Islington who moved into a unit we managed in the year 2000 and stayed for 11 years, the stability and saving they were able to accrue over that period helped them move to their own place, so these are some of the great points of long term rental.\r\n\r\nWe however also had a property bought with a sitting long term tenant, the Landlord requested possession after some months as the rent didn’t match the going market rate. Emotions ran high and it dragged on and cost thousands of pounds in Legal fees, the tenant had become so attached to the property that they didn’t want to leave. Whether you’re comfortable with a long term tenant in your property or not, it is important to be armed with all the information you need to make the right decision on what is right for your investment as situation and circumstance demands.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor all your property related questions and needs, feel free to contact us for a non-obligatory conversation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" width=\"516\" height=\"504\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b><\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Long Term Tenants - Good or Bad.","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"long-term-tenants-good-or-bad","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-02-22 10:32:31","post_modified_gmt":"2019-02-22 10:32:31","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=48357","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

How could boards obtain and retain top talent?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nOf course, this is a challenge for both management and staff and also board positions.\r\n\r\nMost leaders will affirm the real value of ensuring that the right people are recruited into critical positions.  Their job is so much easier if their lieutenants are competent, highly motivated and with the right personal skills to fit into the team.  It is usually better to leave a vacancy open until it can be filled with the right person – and that applies at senior management level as well as at board level.\r\n\r\nFor both executive and board positions, it is now commonplace to use search consultants.  You may consider you know all the players in the sector who might be potential recruits, but you would be surprised how effective search consultants are at homing in on the best talent.  Having search consultants as ‘middlemen’ to negotiate terms also shields the candidate and the organisation from the aggravation that direct negotiation might entail.\r\n\r\nIt is essential that the search consultant is given a clear specification of the nature of the talent being sought.  That presupposes that the board (in the case of board positions) has taken the trouble to work out what talent it needs to refresh the board – which is important.  The board should allow the search consultant to challenge this specification.  Similar considerations apply to the use of search consultants to fill executive positions.  Be careful not to specify just the technical skills sought: personality qualities are just as important.\r\n\r\nOnce top talent has been obtained, it is not only a challenge to retain that talent: it is also a challenge to ensure that retained talent is not losing its cutting edge but continues to perform to a high standard.  The latter is where leadership comes in!  Many of the measures which will aid in retaining top talent will also contribute to ensuring that talent continues to perform well: for instance:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>A supportive, enjoyable culture<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Provision of adequate resources to enable work to be done well<\/li>\r\n \t<li>The intrinsic interest and fulfilment in the work<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Both opportunity for fulfilment and also recognition of achievement and advancement following achievement<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Remuneration at or above market rates<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Reward schemes which acknowledge good performance<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhile the above categories are germane to management and staff, they also apply in varied ways to board members.  For instance, independent, non-executive directors are likely to perform better if they receive a reasonable fee for their efforts – even though many corporate governance codes take the position that it is inappropriate for independent directors to receive any performance=related rewards.  Corporate governance codes often recommend that the performance of boards, board committees and individual directors should be evaluated, and feedback is important. For more insights on how to implement this, please attend my forthcoming programme organised by TEXEM scheduled to come up on the 10th and 11th of April in Lagos.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Read

manage economic and regulatory volatility?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nIt is often said that the only thing we can be certain about, is that the future is uncertain.  We foolishly tend to plan on the basis that present trends will continue into the future, but they are likely not to do so.  At present, the automobile industry is in disarray due to future uncertainty about diesel engines, electric vehicles, and future tariff-free automobile trading between Japan and EU, and Brexit.  The question is whether their boards undertook proper scenario planning in a timely way.  This emphasises the importance of risk identification, risk assessment and risk mitigation which should all feature at board level, not being left just to management.  Risk committees of boards are becoming more critical.  Boards should seek to be comfortable that key risks across the organisation have been identified and are being mitigated sufficiently so that the organisation is performing within its risk appetite.\r\n\r\nRegulatory volatility is often likely to be predictable in its nature.  Take for instance the current anti-social consequences of social media.  It should have been possible for the boards of social media companies, and in particular, their independent directors, to have identified the risk of attracting governmental regulation of social media companies, and to have designed their business model to minimise rather than attract that risk.  Many regulatory measures come into effect because of the misconduct of organisations and are therefore often predictable by management and boards of those organisations.  When predicted, measures may be taken to minimise the risk of increased regulation.  Alternatively, companies should be ‘one step in front of the regulator’, able to adapt to the changing regulatory environment in a timely way.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n \t<li><strong> How can directors strike a balance between the pursuit of legitimate corporate strategic goals and the concerns of directors and executives who perceive themselves at increased personal legal risk for corporate wrongdoing?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nCorporate strategic goals are only legitimate if they are legal, and achieved in legal ways.  The old school of corporate governance might have averred that the sole aim of business is to maximise profit.  But even Milton Friedman, that arch doyen of free-market economics, added ‘so long as it stays within the rules of the game’:\r\n\r\n‘There is one and only one social responsibility of business – to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits, so long as it stays within the rules of the game ...’\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn their pursuit of added value, there is a temptation to sail close to the wind.  It has been suggested that any business will be corrupt if it sees a chance of increasing value significantly, especially if (a) it considers there is little or no chance of being ‘found out’ or that the consequences will not be serious should discovery be made, and\/or (b) its survival or future success will not be under threat.  Perhaps a more sober assessment would be to say that a small proportion of businesses will be honest in all circumstances, another small percentage will be dishonest whenever the opportunity presents itself, and the vast majority in the middle will be easily swayed depending upon the opportunity and potential consequences.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe progressive, contemporary and positive perspective is that it is in the enlightened long-term self-interest of organisations to be socially responsible corporate citizens – which includes adhering to the law and best practice.  Some would say that this is often just politically correct rhetoric formulated to encourage companies to behave on the broader ESG (environment, social and governance) interest.  Make no mistake, making a profit is the principal social duty of business.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEffective hard and soft law, as well as regulation, are necessary counter-balances to the temptation for management and boards to engage in wrongdoing.  Sometimes boards set management extreme and conflicting targets which encourage wrongdoing or questionable business practices.  Perverse incentives for management, agreed by the board, can exacerbate this.  Frequently the board will be unaware of the corners being cut by the administration.  A key issue is how board obtain the assurance they need that their policies are being implemented by management and that there are no ‘banana skins’ round the corner that the business is likely to slip over.  Many of the mechanisms boards have in place should be designed to mitigate this assurance black hole: space doesn’t allow these to be itemised here.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAcross the world, the personal legal and regulatory responsibilities of management and directors are tending to increase, with a corresponding increase in penalties for violation.  The risk to directors is reduced by an open culture, high-quality information to the board, open dialogue at board meetings and a commitment to high standards of corporate governance.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA director is a professional person. Professionals are not infallible, nor expected to be.  But they will be culpable if they are negligent.  The record of board meetings will be an important source to demonstrate whether or not the board and its members have done their duty.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol start=\"6\">\r\n \t<li><strong> Does the board have a role in monitoring the organisational culture and leadership tone?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nYes indeed.  But it is much more than this.  The board’s role is not just an oversight role in monitoring management with respect to, among other things, culture and leadership tone.  The board’s purpose is to determine, inter alia, the organisation’s culture and leadership tone.  More than that, the board must be exemplars of the organisation’s culture and leadership tone.  If it isn’t, then the board shouldn’t expect the intended culture and leadership tone to be observed at management levels.  The chairman of the board has a huge responsibility to ensure that the behaviour of the board and its members are strictly ethical.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol start=\"7\">\r\n \t<li><strong> What are some of the highlights of this forthcoming Masterclass at TEXEM?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nIt is newly designed to ensure that participants are made aware of the measures and approaches available to impact positively on board and director effectiveness; when they are appropriate; and how they may be implemented.  The intention is to inspire participants with proven ways to re-engineer corporate governance in practice and to provide practical ‘toolkit’ advice on how to apply these state-of-the-art methods.  Those with significant prior experience will have the opportunity to benchmark their understanding against best practices which will contribute to effectiveness.  Networking and debating with other workshop participants will give valuable opportunities to identify the pitfalls and the tactics to resolve those challenges. Finally, allow me to state some of TEXEM’s unique selling points for you to be the judge of the quality of their programmes:\r\n\r\n-Excellent reputation of offering tailored, relevant and context-rich executive education programmes which are relevant and has an impact on the bottom line.\r\n\r\n-A network of key stakeholders in Europe and North America that we have worked with in the past, which we could deploy towards the delivery of executive development programmes.\r\n\r\n-The impressive track record on customer satisfaction with 60% of our delegates being repeats customers.\r\n\r\n-Understanding of the challenges that organisations face and committed, distinguished advisory board, which have a passion for the growth of Africa.\r\n\r\n-Great networking opportunities with very senior executives as participants and over six hundred years of experience of participants and faculties in every programme thus steepening the learning curve of participants via peer to peer learning moderated by world-renowned faculties.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" width=\"417\" height=\"407\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b><\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"Creating an Effective Board","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"creating-an-effective-board","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-art-of-sleeping\/","post_modified":"2019-02-25 12:03:24","post_modified_gmt":"2019-02-25 12:03:24","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=49488","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

He responds quickly to any issues with the house and the facilities management of his property is second to none. I cannot remember a time that we were without water or the rubbish was not collected on time, or the soakaway evacuated as and when due.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut the Landlord has done something that I can never forgive him for. In fact when my tenancy expires, I will leave his house. You see, I started renting a unit of 3 bedroom townhouse in his complex when rents in our estate in Lekki were very high. The estate had only a few houses and demand outstripped supply so I was compelled to ‘beg’ him to accept the N3.5m annual rent.  He refused, saying he wanted a corporate tenant and not an individual as a tenant. After a while, I got used to it and since the others in the complex were paying the same thing, it was not so bad.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOver the last 4 years however, the estate filled up and over time there were more houses than tenants and ‘For Let’ signs started to show up. The agent that got me my house offered me a newer unit at the same price but I declined, thinking that it will be hurtful to the Landlord. Now, over the past two years, due to the glut, house rents started coming down, to the point that newer houses were collecting between N2.8m to N3m per annum as rent while older houses like the one I currently stay in, would take N2.5m.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_61562\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-61562\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/my-landlord-has-cheated-me-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" \/> Does a landlord have an obligation to tell his sitting tenants that he will accept a lower rent than the amount they are paying currently?[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<u>All this while, my landlord has been collecting N3.5m from me but was collecting N2.5m from the newer tenants.<\/u> After paying my last renewal, I found out that my neighbour, who had just moved in, paid only N2.5m as rent! I was livid. I went to the landlord and accused him of disloyalty. He kept looking at me as if I was speaking Greek. After a while, he said that I should not worry and that he will accept N2.5m as next year’s rent. I refused. If he does not return N1m to me now or adjust my next year’s rent of N2.5m by N1m (so I will only pay N1.5m) I will not stay in the house.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHe responded that he could not do that as we had agreed at the current rent and another term means a new negotiation. He tried to paint me as being unreasonable and going back on a signed and sealed transaction. It was a business transaction and I had the opportunity to reject the terms before committing myself. That, once I had agreed and paid, it was wrong of me to come back to him, to renegotiate the contract!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/a-beautiful-neighbor-is-not-good-for-a-bachelor-tenant\/\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Related Article: A beautiful Neighbour is Not Good!<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nCan you imagine?

The dining overlooks the generous play area with the Guest Bedroom not too far off. The kitchen comes second in size only when compared to the living room - it is massive!\r\n\r\nThe living room and kiddie’s zone are side by side on the ground floor, separated by a wall to ensure the kids are closely monitored while they play. The dining area is by the corner, open to the music from the living room and drawing everyone together. It’s a modern family affair right here!\r\n\r\n<strong>Upper floor:<\/strong> Getting to the cut plane view of the upper floor, the wood flooring of the bedrooms is enhanced by the plush rugs at the center of each bedroom, and the dash of colours in different sections (the blue sofa of the family lounge, potted plants, e.t.c.) add to the beauty of this amazing layout.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-61567\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/4-Bedroom-1B.Q.-Fully-Detached-Duplex-–-ROYAL-Design-Scheme-2-3-300x232.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"414\" height=\"320\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe living room decor is a personal favourite and has an undeniable “wow” effect. There is a unique harmony of shapes and colours in this cool and breezy living room and the blue sofa spotted with a mix of blue and white throw pillows is a subtle detail. The lustre of the white circular coffee table on the circular rug contrasts beautifully with the black hues of the grand piano and its unique mustard green bench stool. The wood TV wall and console leaves you adds warmth to the scheme..\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-61568\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/4-Bedroom-1B.Q.-Fully-Detached-Duplex-–-ROYAL-Design-Scheme-2-4-300x257.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"433\" height=\"371\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-61569\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/4-Bedroom-1B.Q.-Fully-Detached-Duplex-–-ROYAL-Design-Scheme-2-5-300x257.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"370\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe feature wall in the dining is elegantly designed with warm wooden panels - the warmth spreading out from the wall surface visually expands the warm ambiance of the room. The dramatic lighting created by the spotlights excellently accentuates this tasteful finish. The choice of wood is consistent throughout the entire space; you can see how the same choice of wood grain and colour is used on the TV wall, creating a unique symmetry and balance with the beige floor. It feels light, airy, and open especially with its use of the sleek black and white dining set.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-61572\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/4-Bedroom-1B.Q.-Fully-Detached-Duplex-–-ROYAL-Design-Scheme-2-6-300x257.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"444\" height=\"380\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere is a complete transformation of this kitchen with a simple addition of tone.

The colorful rug creates this visual feeling of being outdoors on lush grass - pretty colourful patterns emulate the reds of roses and blues of violets.  The open shelved wall unit with side drawers will be a great attraction for children and will keep them busy for the nanny to catch a breath! But who says the playroom can’t have taste? Clearly not our designers because the array of graceful vases and beautiful lampshade on the contemporary shelf speak volumes about the affluence of this particular home. The framed bambi on the wall is just as colourful as vibrant as the child’s mind.

The report, according to David Schwimmer, CEO, London Stock Exchange Group “identifies Africa’s most inspirational and dynamic private, high-growth companies to a global market”.\r\n\r\nThe Companies to Inspire Africa report is a listing of 360 leading private corporates across 32 Africa countries that demonstrably outperform their sector and market peers. Aimed at improving awareness on the region’s most dynamic companies, the report showcases outstanding stories of innovation, growth and entrepreneurship in African business to a global audience. To be included in the list, companies needed to be privately held, and show an excellent rate of growth and potential to power African development.\r\n\r\nReacting to Alpha Mead Group’s listing in the LSEG report, Femi Akintunde, Group Managing Director, said the listing is another attestation to Alpha Mead’s capacity for growth, transparency and strong corporate governance regime.\r\n\r\nHe furthered: “one of the things that has driven us over the years, is the need to expand across Africa and provide an all encompassing service that makes the real difference in the businesses and operations of our customers”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Read also:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/fg-seeks-advisers-to-concession-tafawa-balewa-square\/\">FG Seeks Advisers to Concession Tafawa Balewa Square<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/my-landlord-has-cheated-me-2\/\">My Landlord has cheated me!<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“We observed the dynamics of the market and the challenges of most multinationals to run smooth operations across Africa with unified standards; and we chose to invest in developing our people, processes and technologies, expand our operations across major cities in Africa and warehouse key parts of the Real Estate value chain in one place for organisations with desire to implement a global Real Estate contract strategy”.\r\n\r\n“It is therefore fulfilling to see a prestigious report like the <strong><em>Companies to Inspire Africa<\/em><\/strong> attesting to the standard we have designed for our customers. For us, sustainable business operations goes beyond meeting the varying needs of our customers across Africa, it is also about assuring new international brands planning to come into Africa that the continent is no longer a black box. So, for us, this insignia of LSEG; also re-affirms that the capacities, opportunities and possibilities we are creating are recognised and accepted globally”.\r\n\r\nThis is the third time in seven years, that Alpha Mead will be featured in rankings or recognitions of African promising companies. In 2012, it was ranked 16<sup>th<\/sup> Fast Growth 50 Company in Nigeria by the Allworld Network Inc. (co-founded by Professor Michael Porter of Harvard Business School) and The Tony Elumelu Foundation. Also, in 2013, Femi Akintunde, won the emerging category of the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year, West Africa.\r\n\r\nThese are among several international and local awards like the European CEO awards in 2014, Middle East and Africa Award 2017, Africa Real Estate Conference Award 2018, among others.\r\n\r\nFor the Alpha Mead Group CEO It is not just about a African company being recognised on the global stage, it is about an Africa Real Estate business showcasing the potentials of the market through success stories and the opportunities such recognitions create for the African Real Estate industry in the global scheme of things.\r\n\r\nThe LSEG’s Companies to Inspire Africa report was produced in partnership with African Development Bank Group, CDC Group, PWC and Asoko Insight who contributed their insight and expertise to select the featured companies out of a total of 4,000 companies in Africa.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about London Stock Exchange Group’s Companies to Inspire Africa 2019’ report please visit lseg.com\/inspireafrica\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n=End=\r\n\r\n<strong>About Alpha Mead Group\r\n\r\n<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAlpha Mead Group is a Total Real Estate Solutions Company established to provide robust business support services to local and international Real Estate investors or owners with interests in Facilities Management, Real Estate Development and Advisory, Security Systems and Technologies, Training, Healthcare Management and Real Estate Financing Services.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOperating in more that 10 African countries, Alpha Mead is Certified to International Standards of ISO 9001:2015 by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service, UKAS.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor further information, please visit: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alphamead.com\">www.alphamead.com<\/a> | All media enquiries to: sesan.ogunyooye@alphamead.com| Phone:  +234 – 80 -999 9 - 343 | +234 – 809 -5178 - 711\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"Alpha Mead Group","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"alpha-mead-group","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/fg-seeks-advisers-to-concession-tafawa-balewa-square\/","post_modified":"2019-04-26 06:21:03","post_modified_gmt":"2019-04-26 06:21:03","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=61606","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

However, there are ways of getting the property lower than the advertised properties. Here are four ingenious ways to do so\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><strong> BUY IN BULK\/BUY MORE THAN ONE:<\/strong> If you can afford it, buy more than one unit (land or property) from the developer. The cost per unit will be lower than just buying one. If you do not have the finance to buy in bulk as an individual, buying as a group is a good option. When you buy as a group, you have a stronger bargaining power unlike buying as an individual. You will observe that most cooperative societies are able to get land and houses at great prices because of the strength in their numbers. If you and your friends are interested in getting land or houses in a particular area, you can search for it together and negotiate as a group. Some developers even advertise the benefits of bulk purchases with offers like “Buy 5, get 1 free” sales promotions. This means that six individuals can buy six plots for the price of five plots.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n \t<li><strong> BUY DURING FESTIVITIES:<\/strong> Most real estate companies give discounts and do promotional offers during festivities. In the past, many real estate companies have given discounts and gift items to those buying properties around Easter, Ileya, Christmas, Ramadan, Children’s Day, Independence Day, Worker’s Day and even Valentine’s Day. Delaying your purchase to the next festivity can save you some money. I know an individual who bought a plot of land from a real estate company for N3Million in March of a particular year, only for the real estate company to do an Easter promo in April of that same year selling the property for N2Million. Thus making those buying in April gain N1Million.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<strong>Read also:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h3 class=\"entry-post-title\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/outdoor-living\/\">Outdoor Living…<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h3 class=\"entry-post-title\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/tenants-can-install-their-floors\/\">Tenants can install their floors<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n \t<li><strong> BUY FROM A PREVIOUS SUBSCRIBER WHO IS DESPERATE TO SELL:<\/strong> It is not only the developer selling units in the estate; usually there are previous buyers who now want to sell. Some of these buyers are willing to sell at lower prices: either because of desperation or because they had bought when prices were lower than the current price and can sell at lower than current prices and still make a profit. These previous buyers usually contact the developer of its staff to sell for them so remember to ask if they have any such sellers on their list.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n \t<li><strong> REQUEST FOR A DISCOUNT:<\/strong> If you are not buying in bulk, buying as a group, buying during festivities and you could not find someone desperate to sell, you can always request for a discount. Most real estate developers have some internal mechanisms to accommodate customers who request for a discount. If you do not request for a discount, you will not get any.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<em><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/best-deals-when-buying-properties\/3-102\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-62237\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-62237\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/3-27-300x151.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"346\" \/><\/a><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>Written by Ayobayo Babade. <\/em>\r\n\r\n<em> <\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>Ayobayo Babade is a lawyer, real estate broker &amp; agro-business consultant.

Depending on which side of the political fence one sits, the Presidential election could be considered the fairest or the worst. Nigerians have been trading barbs and political insults at one another …….but they have not stooped from trading properties with each other. And the animosity and tension has not had any substantial impact on the market according to informal surveys carried out by Castles Lifestyle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOne of the accepted positions of practitioners in the real estate market is that property transactions during the electoral cycle will fall as property owners adopt a ‘wait and see’ approach. There will however be new players in the market: politicians seeking to sell their properties to fund their campaigns. These deals are usually discreet and because of the desperation of the politicians, the sales price is below the market price.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn this election cycle, there appears to be a change in the market dynamics. Politicians appear to have either found another way of funding their elections because there were very few election related sales. Some have postulated that the market is not liquid enough for the quick sales turnaround that politicians required so they did not bother to put their properties on the market. Others opined that the fear of the regulatory authorities particularly the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to target property sales by Politically Exposed Persons also contributed.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMarket sentiment was also largely unaffected by the elections. There was no slowdown in property advert placements or lack of interest in the buying and letting public. Transactions were not stalled for the elections. Developers also continued apace with their construction and marketing of properties with some breaking new ground. Instructions to seek JVs and other transactions were nit withdrawn.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe general sentiment of the market was that property investment has long-term consequences and short-term considerations like election results should not impact it. Indeed this way of thinking squares with the view of investors who look beyond the everyday behaviour of the economy and focus on long-term considerations of where the market will be in the future.  Unlike the stock market, those in the real estate market believe the future is bright enough to invest in.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/election-season\/2-113\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-62252\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-62252\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/2-32-300x158.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"568\" height=\"299\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nProfessor <strong>Mahmood Yakubu<\/strong>,  INEC Chairman\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>","post_title":"Election season","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"election-season","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-04-29 11:59:34","post_modified_gmt":"2019-04-29 11:59:34","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=62247","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

The FIABCI World President, Assen Makedonov and the immediate past President, Farook Mahmood, will also attend the event.

The scorecard will reveal the current Nigerian property market conditions in a bid to identify the key areas for reform. Mr. Adele said that, “ as markets mature and professionals are nurtured, better investments will be introduced into right property types needed in the country and the GDP of the country will improve”. FIABCI-NIGERIA is in a position to bring together all the major stakeholders in the real estate industry to offer solutions and also to meet the ever increasing demand for affordable housing within cities.  Mr. Adeniji added that FIABCI Nigeria would continually present the property scorecard in Nigeria until professionals in the Real Estate industry conform to right practices.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_62257\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"710\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/fiabci-to-unveil-nigeria-property-scorecard\/2-114\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-62257\"><img class=\" wp-image-62257\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/2-33-300x170.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"710\" height=\"402\" \/><\/a> L-R: Secretay General, International Real Estate Federation (FIABCI) Nigeria, Ayodeji Oduleye; FIABCI Nigeria President, Adeniji Adele FIABCI Nigeria Vice President, Gbenga Ismail; and Treasurer, Akin Opatola, at a Press Briefing On Their Annual Assessment Of The Nation’s Housing Sector...Recently.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong><em>FIABCI-Nigeria Awards 2019 holds on Friday, 25 January 2019 at Lagos Oriental Hotel.

From Lekki Phase 1 to Epe, new residential estates have come up. The residentai estates are varied: there are Government planned estates like  Femi Okunnu Estate and private estates like Victoria Garden City. There are estate like Abraham Adesanya Esate with only bungalows and other like Safe Court Apartments in Elegushi where there are only highrises. In Lekki one finds residential estates dedicated to recreation like Lakowe Lakes with its magnificent 18 hole golf course. There are many more planned estates and developments in the axis and homeowners can expect some interesting designs and concepts.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut the major driver of Lekki ‘s future will not be the excellent residential homes and estates but the commercial projects that are coming up. In the early 200s, Chevron, the massive oil company, set up its Head Quarters along the Lekki Epe Expressway, <u>the immediate impact of its presence was that the area came to be known as ‘Chevron’.<\/u>  This overt impact masked the fact that many of its well paid employees started renting and buying in the axis. Well laid out and serviced estates like  Crown Estate and Victoria Garden City attracted these employees. They also as cooperatives, were behind massive estates like NICON Town and Twin Lakes.  So apart from the well built estates, the main driver for these employees living in Lekki was the proximity to their office.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn an estate close to Greensprings School in Lekki, the developer was at his wits end. There were just no takers for the already developed houses. But within 6 months, all the houses in the estate were let. And because the properties were let, the developer was able to sell the houses to investors who wanted the income stream from the rents. Who rented the properties? Workers from the contractors working on the Dangote Refinery.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese two examples show that massive projects that employ a lot of workers will impact the way Lekki will develop. Instead of Lekki residents getting on the Lekki Epe Expressway to go to work in Victoria Island, Ikoyi, Lagos Island and even the Mainland as is the case now, these residents will live and work in Lekki. Already Lekki Phase 1 is home to many small and medium sized companies and both residents from Lekki and outside Lekki go to work there. There are also a number of commercial concerns on the Lekki Epe Expressway and shopping malls offer retail employment opportunities.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut the drivers are going to be major projects that will create thousand of high and mid-level jobs. Shell, the major oil company, is to move its headquarters to the Lekki axis as well as major projects like the Dangote Refinery and Dangote Fertilizer Plant will bring thousands of these jobs to Lekki. It will make sense for these workers to live, shop and get their children to school there. Like the workers in Chevron, they will form cooperative or groups and get estates developed to suit their tastes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Read also:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h3 class=\"entry-post-title\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/fiabci-to-unveil-nigeria-property-scorecard\/\">FIABCI to Unveil Nigeria Property Scorecard<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h3 class=\"entry-post-title\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/a-first-class-master-bedroom-design\/\">A First Class Master Bedroom Design<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe Lekki Deep Sea Port and Lekki International Airport may not directly employ the large number of employees like oil companies and massive conglomerates but they attract businesses which do. For the Lekki Deep Sea Port, think Apapa and for the International Airport, think Ikeja. These two projects are going to create commercial areas that will create thousand of jobs, which means that people will live and work in the axis.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs the character of Lekki changes from a predominantly residential axis to a mixed use location, the typology of developed properties will also change. Purpose built warehouses just like in Apapa and Ikeja, to serve the port and industrial concerns that will sprout up in the area will be good investments. Also business parks and office high rises like in Broad Street and Marina in the Lagos Island CBD will have ready tenants in the Lekki of the future.\r\n\r\nThat’s our prediction for how Lekki will turn out in 2039.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\n\r\nAgree?

Property Technology, popular referred to as PropTech, is an array of technological advancement and tools that are currently revolutionizing the way people operate, buy, sell and rent and properties. Globally, investment in PropTech has reached $12.6 billion in 2017 from a mere $20 million in 2010. These new investments have been witnessed in portal listings, agency and brokerages, virtual reality, real estate crowdfunding, collaborative economy (shared spaces), big data and analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence and smart building technologies.\r\n\r\n<em> <\/em>\r\n\r\nBut unlike fintech, the concept of PropTech has not fully gained ground in Nigeria. However, it is no longer a difficult subject to grasp. PropTech could be the deployment of apps within the real estate value chain including construction. The emergence of listing portals, crowdfunding and virtual reality tours in Nigeria all falls within the PropTech space. But there is a lot more than this in the PropTech bouquet that hasn’t happened in Nigeria yet. For example, democratising property investment in Nigeria is still at infancy even though smart city developments like the Eko Atlantic City are leading the path to energy efficiency and massive PropTech revolution.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nReal estate is known to be hugely contingent on legal relationships and savvy negotiation with counterparties. Will PropTech disrupt or eliminate the conventional role of real estate agents or legal personnel? What about the popular property inspection – Will virtual reality replace the traditional site visits organized by agents? How about tile search and validation – Will the real estate developers and local municipalities adopt blockchain technology?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>HOW DOES THE CHANGING PROPTECH LANDSCAPE AFFECT THE NIGERIAN REAL ESTATE MARKET?<\/strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe future for real estate (PropTech) in Nigeria is much closer that you might be thinking right now. Although the real estate industry is a conservative one, disruptions are already happening in sizeable pockets along the value chain. Agreed, it is not yet as aggressive as fintech, but the likes of Tolet; Estate intel; Filmo Realty; hotels.ng; CoBuildit; One Square Metre; Zama; Fibre; Nigerian Property Centre; etc are beginning to innovate and dare the conservative real estate practice in Nigeria. Traditional methods and conventional practices inch by inch are being broken with the goal of customer satisfaction and benefits.\r\n\r\n<em> <\/em>\r\n\r\nWe are in the fourth industrial revolution, and technology is determining how we live our lives. The risk of becoming antiquated while remaining resistant to these global changes is enormous. Besides, billions of dollars are being invested in the global PropTech space.  Projections are that the industry will hit US$ 20 billion in 2019. With Asia – Pacific region raking in about US$ 5 billion since 2013, a lot of interest in Africa is seen by venture capital firms. Who will be the winners and losers? Who will be affected? Developers, Lawyers, Valuers, Construction Companies, or Agents? What are the matters of concerns to various real estate stakeholders?

I stared at the heading of the form given to me by the police officer with dread. Whatever I wrote there would either send some innocents to jail or wreck a marriage. My neighbour, Shade looked at me with an inscrutable expression on her face. She could save the situation by explaining who was at her flat and at what time, but that as we well knew would lead to more questions and eventually to the Landlord’s wife. Then it will be the Landlord that would need to make an accused statement to his wife.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThey seemed so close. My Landlord and his wife. Even my wife said so, as they ‘interviewed’ us four years ago to see if we merited the position of being their tenants. We passed by virtue of my job with an oil company but most importantly, because my wife was from Ondo State. It was not an issue of tribalism, as Mr and Mrs Landlord as we called them, though <em>Yoruba <\/em>in origin, were not from Ondo. It was because they believed that women from certain parts of Nigerian, Ondo included, were good housekeepers. That was the level of interest they took in their tenants, insisting that they interviewed each one. Before long, a pattern had emerged. Mr and Mrs Landlord would only let their flats to married couples, with the wife being of high educational background (she was not likely to ‘breed’ children’), good jobs and well brought up children. All other persons, no matter how well endowed, would not pass the Landlords test.\r\n\r\nI must admit that though I found their system parochial, it seemed to work. All tenants got on well together, contributing when required to the general upkeep of the building and there was little or no friction in the house with all of us keeping to ourselves.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThen the first issue occurred. One of the neighbours raised an alarm that she had lost a significant amount of jewellery. After questioning by her own husband, she admitted that she might have lent it to a friend, as she was wont to do. We left her to crack her brain on which friend or acquaintance would have the pieces of jewellery. The second issue was the appearance of ‘Mrs’ Shade Balogun. I have queried the use of ‘Mrs’ as we never saw her with any husband. It seemed quite odd that she had been able to pass the Mr and Mrs Landlord test. The third issue was when one of the tenants lost his elder brother and was compelled to look after his brother’s son.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFrom day 1, Emeka, the bereaved son was a handful.  There were rows from the flat, he stole his uncle’s car to go all night partying, the diesel from the generator got missing, he fought with the security guard, the list was endless. <u>“What has Emeka done now?” was a common refrain in the compound.<\/u> When the Landlord raised the issue with me, I pleaded for his understanding as the young lad had just lost his father and was bound to react, one way or another.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><a style=\"color: #ff6600;\" href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/my-landlord-has-cheated-me-2\/\"><strong>Related Article: My Landlord has cheated me!<\/strong><\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLife continued as usual, until one fateful Friday night, or should I say morning. I had been tossing and turning all night, feeling very restless and in order not to disturb my wife, got up from bed and sat on a chair on my veranda, enjoying the early morning breeze. I knew it was 2 a.m. in the morning because I had glanced casually at the clock in the living room. As I sat blowing to cool a cup of tea I had made, I saw a movement. Emeka had left the confines of his uncle’s flat, crept to the low end of the fence and jumped out. I had hardly started shaking my head in disgust when I noticed another sound. Someone had left Mrs Balogun’s flat and was also creeping out of the compound. As the person passed the security light, his face was clearly visible, even in the dark. It was Mr Landlord. Belying his age, he nimbly climbed over the fence and was off. A minute later, I heard the sound of a car. The sound must have woken up our lazy guard who walked out of his shed, looked up, saw me and waved “ I no dey sleep” he called in pidgin English.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLater that morning was the uproar. Someone had stolen one of the co-tenant’s jewellery. It was an inside job and so all suspicion immediately went to Emeka. As he was not back from his sojourn, it was assumed that he had escaped. I contributed the information that I had seen him climbing the gate at 2 o’clock in the morning. Then the rascal walked in, cool as a cucumber. If he indeed stole the jewellery,  the boy was a first class actor. He denied it completely. My irate neighbours took the matter to the police, where I was a prime witness. Emeka insisted that not only had he not taken the jewellery, there was a man who jumped the fence after him. He did not recognise the person but if I had seen him, Emeka, climb the fence, I must have seen the other person. Emeka, as well as all the other tenants and the policemen, turned their gaze at me. At that moment, Mr and Mrs Landlord walked into the station. I saw Emeka’s looking them but obviously he did not recognise the landlord as the man who climbed the gate. Everyone’s attention turned back to me: was it true that I saw someone else climb out over the fence?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>How should I answer? If I tell the truth, then the landlord will have to answer to his wife. Or he may deny it and then it would be his word against mine. Either way, they will not be favourable when I come to renew my rent, that is, if they renew it at all. On the other hand, if I do not, then Emeka ‘s guilt, which I am not sure of, will be confirmed. Help! I need advice. email: feedback@castles.com.ng<\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"What was the Landlord doing in Shade’s flat at 2 a.m.?","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"what-was-the-landlord-doing-in-shades-flat-at-2-a-m","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-04-29 11:58:40","post_modified_gmt":"2019-04-29 11:58:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=62440","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

There are five places where you can conduct a search on your property before purchase depending on the title the property has and facts surrounding the sale.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><strong> Lands Registry:<\/strong> If the property has a registered title like a Crown Grant, Land Certificate, Registered Conveyance, Registered Court Judgement, Certificate of Occupancy, or a Governor’s Consent, the place to search is the Lands Registry where you are to obtain the Certified True Copy of the registered title. This is because the Lands Registry keeps record of transactions to land which have been brought to the knowledge of the state through the process of registration.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n \t<li><strong> Surveyor General’s Office:<\/strong> If the property does not have a registered title and you desire to know the status of the land as well as the zoning, the Surveyor General’s Office is the place to go to where you are to obtain a Land Information Certificate (LIC). The LIC will inform you about the status of the land – free, excised, acquired or committed as well as the zoning of the land – Residential, commercial, industrial or agricultural. This will also assist the buyer to know what title will be processed on the property – Certificate of Occupancy, Ratification or if no title can be gotten on the property.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n \t<li><strong> Probate Registry:<\/strong> The Probate Section of the Court is the segment saddled with the responsibility of dealing with matters relating to the estate of a deceased person. If the holder of the registered title is deceased, there will be the need for a Probate search to determine the authenticity of the Probate Grant or Letters of Administration. If the title holder makes a Will before his death, the Will will be entered into Probate and a Probate Grant will be obtained before an Assent will be made by the Executors of the Will to the named beneficiaries. If the property holder dies without a Will, the survivors will apply for a Letter of Administration to administer the Estate of the deceased. The Administrators of the Estate shall be legally entitled to transfer the property to the would-be buyer.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-future-of-lekki\/\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong>Related Article: The Future of Lekki<\/strong><\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n \t<li><strong> Court Registry:<\/strong> If there is a suspicion of a legal dispute relating to the property, a search in the Court Registry should be conducted. When there is a legal dispute in relation to a property, such property is said to be<em> Lis Pendens<\/em>. Lagos State has the Lagos State Lis Pendens Electronic Information System accessible online at <a href=\"http:\/\/lagoslispendens.com.ng\/\">http:\/\/lagoslispendens.com.ng\/<\/a> which shows properties that have pending litigation at any of the divisions of the Lagos State High Court. A search on the platform can give preliminary information regarding the existence of a legal dispute in relation to the property.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n \t<li><strong> Social Search:<\/strong> If after you have done the other searches above, you still feel the need to probe further, a social search is recommended. My father and real estate mentor, Mr. Tope Babade, often says that “If your instincts tell you something is wrong with a transaction; check again, something is wrong somewhere.” One of the most revealing searches to conduct is what I term “Social Search.” This involves going to the property in question and asking neighbors, shop owners and transporters (like Okada men) in the area about the property in question. Facts about the property not revealed in documents are often revealed via Social Search.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_62486\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"277\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-62486\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Where-to-Conduct-a-Search-on-your-Property.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"277\" height=\"276\" \/> Ayobayo Babade is a lawyer, real estate broker &amp; agro-business consultant.

According to Chuka, “ there was a clear intention to produce an entry facade with identical but distinctive entrances. The red portals achieve this”. Apart from their aesthetic appeal, each portal acts as a canopy for the doorway as well as the final step up to the unit.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_62542\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"486\"]<img class=\" wp-image-62542\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Fenestration-3-297x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"486\" height=\"491\" \/> A cantilever roof terrace cover with oculus is the immediate focal point of this design. But by restraining himself from slapping regular large windows on the ‘non-communicating’ street view, the façade has a more intriguing presence. If windows are the ‘eyes’ of a building, one gets the impression of the left eye shut and the right one squinting to focus on an object.[\/caption]","post_title":"Fenestration","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"fenestration","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-04-29 14:16:32","post_modified_gmt":"2019-04-29 14:16:32","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=62534","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

As veteran parents of two young children, we had gone through the night time feeding and all that and whenever we hear the sound from a neighbouring flat we let out a sympathetic chuckle and go back to bed. But these cries we were hearing this night was particularly grating on our nerves. Not because we disliked the baby but the fact that the baby in question was pushing up our service charge bill.\r\n\r\nLet me explain. We live in a block of six flats with five other occupants. Each flat is tenanted by similar type families- middle class with about 2 children, except for Okey, an investment banker, whose family is in the United States. The flats are serviced with 24\/7 water and electricity. For logistic reasons, the flats are divided into two wings with three on the right wing with its own power and water services while the other wing also has its own. The cleaning of common parts and security is done jointly but the real costs are the water and electricity costs. So our own wing, which also has Okey on the ground floor and Kunle, an investment banker who lives with his wife and two children in the middle floor with me on the top floor have agreed that the generator that serves our wing will only be on from 7 in the night to 7am and that with Okey being ‘single’ he will pay a fifth while Kunle and I, with families will pay two fifths each of the water and power service charge. This system worked very well and even when Okey’s family came over, because it was for a short time, we didn’t alter the system.\r\n\r\nThe problem came when, Kunle’s brother showed up one day with his wife, a new born baby and their mother. His brother’s house had been sacked by flood and they needed a place to stay at short notice. We were all sympathetic at first. However, one month, became two months and this became six months until, they had been staying with Kunle for eight months. Don’t ask me what happened to Kunle’s brother’s flat. I was not told and it was not in my place to enquire. What I know was that the service charges for the water and power bills were going up steadily. When I asked the security guard, he explained that because of the baby, the system of  putting the generator on for twelve hours had been amended to ‘whenever power was cut by PHCN’ (or is it Eko Disco now?) . Infuriated I asked who gave him the authority and calmed down when he said it was both Okey and Kunle when I asked Okey, he admitted that Kunle’s brother had virtually blackmailed him with the issue of the new born baby and he had to give in. he counselled that I should ‘take it easy’ as it was only for a while as they would soon leave.\r\n\r\nI kept my peace until one day I got a ‘crazy’ service charge bill and charged to Okey’s house to complain and seek his alliance for us to confront Kunle on the steadily increasing service charge bill. When I got to Okey’s flat, I found out that it was empty and the guard told me that yesterday, he had to rush to the United States on a family emergency when would he be back? The guard did not know. Did he drop any money for the service charge? The Facilities manager answered in the negative. So I did not know when Okey would be back but I did know that there would be a shortfall in the service charge account.\r\n\r\nI decided that it was time to confront Kunle. He was quite reasonable at first until he suggested that we share the bill equally until Okey came back. When I replied that, such a suggestion was not fair bearing in mind that he and his extended family were using most of the resources. Then his wife got slightly abusive. I decided to retreat to maintain my dignity.\r\n\r\nI now have two drastic choices: refuse to pay the service charge until we agree to a fair compromise – this will mean the services being cut off and would pressure him to agree. This would also have the impact of creating enmity between the families. The second choice was to report to the Landlord who would not approve of a large family using his facilities and will result in Kunle’s lease not being renewed. The third choice of agreeing to Kunle’s suggestion of sharing the service charge equally? That is not an option at all.\r\n\r\nWhat should the writer do?

{"ID":"63875","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-05-06 13:00:30","post_date_gmt":"2019-05-06 13:00:30","post_content":"The popular traditional model for delivering small building projects where the project owner engages a supervising engineer, builder or contractor and handles the procurement of the materials for the job themselves is now creeply deeply into bigger projects. At least half the projects currently embarked upon by private developers across the country are delivered using this model. The reason for this trend are largely blamed on the overbearing activities of unscrupulous contractors who have made cutting corners a way of life; thereby creating a lot of distrust in the larger circle. Although this model is now largely adopted as a soft landing approach for project owners over the full contract option, if not checked properly, the real objective will be defeated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere are the issues; first you have to engage a competent hand as your supervisor - one who knows the job and is honesty and discipline - very important. Here is why – project happens when materials meet workmanship and supervision in the presence of a catalyst called money. They don’t just happen! Of these three items, the cost associated with materials normally account for some 60 percent of the entire project cost. Therefore naturally, procurement becomes the ‘big fish’.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow it feels smart for a project owner to take on procurement at least to save overall cost and no one will have to accuse you of suffering from acute owner-contractor syndrome (OCS) since you have already engaged a professional on site responsible for managing the construction aspect of the project. Moreso since not much technical skills is needed in mobilizing materials to site. But there is a negative trend now that you may not know.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><a style=\"color: #ff6600;\" href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/eoi-construction-of-obudu-cargo-international-airport\/\"><strong>Related Article: Construction of Obudu Cargo\/International Airport<\/strong><\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\nUnscrupulous Supervising engineers\/Contractors connive with suppliers to manipulate quantities and quality of materials delivered to site in order to get huge cuts in return and this runs throughout the project life cycle. In the process, the owner loses some good amount of project funds. For instance in the first quarter of 2019 alone, a well-known construction supply merchant in Nigeria – SupplyQuickNG recorded at least 16 cases of Site supervisors demanding that they either deliver materials of lesser qualities or quantities than what was requested by their Client or risk losing the supply deal and that the balance from such malicious transactions be paid directly to them. The business manager of the company further revealed that some 77 million naira combined would have been lost by the unsuspecting client in those deals if the company had danced to the tune been played. On one occasion, she recalled that a client ordered for 31 tons of reinforcement based on the bill of quantities he received from his contractor but at the point of loading at the stores, the resident engineer called in to demand that only 22-tons be delivered; that he deliberately scaled up the quantities to 31 so that upon payment, the money for 9 tons can be recalled and paid directly to him. That would have been about 2 million naira loss for the client at an instance if they had compromised.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnother disturbing trend observed is that some will ask that the supplier manipulates the quality of the materials by delivering a mix of substandard and good quality products which is against the original order made by the Client and since they are to approve the delivery, they would simply turn a blind eye to it. Again the idea is to profit illegally at the expense of the integrity of the structure and the trust repose on them by the unsuspecting client. When suppliers refuse to engage in such double-dealings, they lay trumped-up allegations against the supplier to compel the client to reject the delivery. This is just a few of the many issues bordering on the adoption of this model for construction projects, although it has its own merits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn order to curb these excesses, some developers have had to set up a procurement office within the site management structure which will be responsibility for ensuring that only the right qualities and quantities of materials required are delivered to site. Such formation would normally consist of a Quality Control experts and QS. The deployment of technology in procurement processes which allows for minimal exposure to site personnel will also do a great deal.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_63885\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"354\"]<img class=\" wp-image-63885\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/ENg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"354\" height=\"271\" \/> Engr.

{"ID":"63893","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-05-06 13:10:18","post_date_gmt":"2019-05-06 13:10:18","post_content":"Real estate is a capital good and typically requires a large investment sum. The returns are very good, often better than most other investment classes and serves as a hedge against inflation in the long run. However, this investment sum is often hard to come by for the average individual and so it’s important to think critically about how to get in on real estate investments. Here we share three tips to investing in real estate without necessarily breaking the bank.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn this article we are not going to share anything that’s not in the open, it’s definitely not illegal and the ideas are common knowledge. But what may be new is your perspective to real estate investment. People typically think until you own a property that you can visit you have not invested in real estate. Some tips here will not work for you if you still hold that view. Same way as you buy Dangote shares but cannot even visit a Dangote cement plant without a proper invitation or agenda, real estate investment is primarily for the returns you get and not the “feeling” of ownership.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><a style=\"color: #ff6600;\" href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/exceptional-real-estate-opportunities-in-the-lekki-axis\/\"><strong>Related Article: Exceptional Real Estate Opportunities in the Lekki Axis<\/strong><\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, the first way you can invest in real estate with significantly less than a million is by buying the shares of real estate companies. This is a type of “indirect real estate”. Real estate companies typically invest in real estate, so when you buy their shares you are indirectly investing in real estate. Similarly, you can invest in REITs – Real Estate Investment Trusts. They are vehicles that invest primarily in real estate and have a statutory obligation to distribute at least 90% of their annual profit. This makes REITs even more liquid as an investment than most real estate company shares. There are very few real estate shares and REITs in Nigeria but they exist and provide a good platform for you to start your real estate investment journey.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSecondly, you may invest in real estate by pooling funds together with others. This may be through investment clubs, cooperatives or adapting technology through crowdfunding and co-investing platforms like Cobuildit and Coreum. The age old adage – “There is power in numbers” is the rule here and it works. Your one million Naira may not be able to buy more than 10 square metres of land in Lekki but when one hundred people come together, each with a million, they may be able to buy a full plot. Maybe not up to a standard plot, but you get the message. What is essential is everyone gets the same percentage return proportionate to the size of her\/his investment.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFinally, you may invest in property itself. However, due to the low investment sum you have, you have to be very creative. You actually have to be super creative. If you want to invest directly in real estate with less than one million, you will need to do a lot of research and bet on a location that is not yet developed but you believe will be developed soon. The reality is, most places on earth will be developed in one form or another at some point, the million Naira question is how long will it take? These are decisions a good broker can help you discern but the final decision on which option to take will be up to you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_63898\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"257\"]<img class=\" wp-image-63898\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-ways-to-invest-in-real-estate-with-less-than-a-million-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"257\" height=\"171\" \/> Tayo Odunsi CEO, Northcourt RealEstate<br \/>Tayo.odunsi@northcourtrealestate.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_63900\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"159\"]<img class=\" wp-image-63900\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-ways-to-invest-in-real-estate-with-less-than-a-million-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"159\" height=\"233\" \/> Niyi Olumoto, Brokerage Lead, Northcourt RealEstate<br \/>Niyi.olumoto@northcourtrealestate.com[\/caption]","post_title":"3 Ways to Invest in Real Estate with Less than a Million","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"3-ways-to-invest-in-real-estate-with-less-than-a-million","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-05-06 13:10:18","post_modified_gmt":"2019-05-06 13:10:18","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=63893","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

Semidetached Duplex – THRIVE Design Scheme 2 <\/strong>\r\n\r\nLuxury is not just about aesthetics, but about comfort too.\r\n\r\nIt is not every day we see an exquisitely designed interior space that uses reserved colours and shades in its taste, and yet still hold enough visual interest while ultimately delivering great comfort to the user. This is exactly what our design team has been able to achieve in the Thrive Scheme 2 series. From the choice of colours and textures to the interrelationship between the elements in the spaces, this home is one that would peak the excitement of any homeowner. Even the kids’ room is not left out; the spatial grandeur of the room alone is enough to raise curious eyebrows about how so much could fit into one home! There’s nothing quite like it!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFrom the accent leather sofas of the living room on the ground floor to the warm coziness of the children’s bedroom on the upper floor, the concept for this design scheme resonates with the same attribute which echoes the word - COMFORT!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/4-bedroom-duplex-design-scheme-ii\/01_thrive-ds02-gf_2\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-65364\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-65364\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/01_Thrive-DS02-GF_2-300x202.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"526\" height=\"356\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe 3-dimensional imagery shows the absolute brilliance of what we have done with the space. Here, the view shows the entry into this beautiful home and finding oneself in the simple, but tasteful ante room. Right behind the user, in an obscure position is the visitor’s toilet. You can hardly tell it’s there! And that’s what we’re going for - a space that cleverly keeps private business away from prying eyes. It’s just brilliant. Absolutely brilliant!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA deeper exploration into this beautiful home finds you in the robust living area, which spills elegantly into a dining area. The staircase is within a few strides from there. But what absolutely takes the cake on this floor is the kitchen! It’s generous and the layout brilliantly thought-out. It comes complete with a laundry niche, lavish storage spaces and a mini-breakfast bar that can double as a place to sip a glass of wine or two with the occasional guest.  Seeing the pictures of the kitchen (as seen below) can absolutely make anyone fall in love!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe two bedrooms on this floor (guest and maid’s room) alongside the living room with dining and the large kitchen, maximum space utilization is achieved without compromise on functionality especially in the open plan arrangement of the kitchen\/dining. The breakfast nook on the way to the kitchen with two bar stools can also serve for casual dining.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/4-bedroom-duplex-design-scheme-ii\/02_thrive-ds02-ff_2\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-65365\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-65365\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/02_Thrive-DS02-FF_2-300x202.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"423\" height=\"286\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nClimbing up the stairs finds you in the upper floor spaces with an abundance of elegant furniture and decor resulting in vibrant spaces which are lively and yet relaxing. In consistency with the lower floor, there is an undeniable balance between beauty and functionality on this floor. A box room has even been located right opposite the family lounge area to help keep everything organized!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/4-bedroom-duplex-design-scheme-ii\/03_thrive_ds02_livingroom-02a\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-65366\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-65366\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/03_THRIVE_DS02_LIVINGROOM-02a-300x257.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"257\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/4-bedroom-duplex-design-scheme-ii\/04_thrive_ds02_livingroom-01\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-65367\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-65367\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/04_THRIVE_DS02_LIVINGROOM-01-300x257.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"257\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nAppreciating the wonderful interior design on the ground floor, the TV wall with black and wood console assembly makes for a never-boring feature wall; the adjacent wall niche with display wooden shelves keeps the living room classy and inviting. The ceiling design with spotlights is a neat and conservative arrangement, and further contributes to the balance of the space. The modern and unassuming planter in the corner goes on to express the homeowners love for simplicity and tasteful design.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/4-bedroom-duplex-design-scheme-ii\/05_thrive_ds02_dining\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-65368\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-65368\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/05_THRIVE_DS02_DINING-300x257.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"257\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe dining area flows into the kitchen with minimum barrier and beside the mini-breakfast nook. The deep chocolate accent wall of the dining area warms up the space and the cream dining chairs offer a good visual contrast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/4-bedroom-duplex-design-scheme-ii\/06_thrive_ds02_kitchen-01\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-65369\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-65369\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/06_THRIVE_DS02_KITCHEN-01-300x257.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"257\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nOh la la! Now comes the kitchen! The kitchen (on the right picture) is efficiency at its finest with the U-layout leaving everything within reach, it is a chef’s dream realized! Dynamism is then suddenly introduced into the space with the sharp chamfer right above the mini-breakfast nook. The choice of colour for the cabinetry is one that we’re highly proud of. The way the white is complemented beautifully by the silver edges of the cabinets - this kitchen has to offer a 5-star dining experience! Even Chef Gordon Ramsay must have something nice to say about this kitchen space!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/4-bedroom-duplex-design-scheme-ii\/07_thrive_ds02_kitchen-03a\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-65370\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-65370\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/07_THRIVE_DS02_KITCHEN-03a-300x257.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"257\" \/><\/a>          <a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/4-bedroom-duplex-design-scheme-ii\/08_thrive_ds02_kitchen-02\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-65371\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-65371\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/08_THRIVE_DS02_KITCHEN-02-300x257.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"257\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nThis white kitchen is elegant and exemplifies refinement.

The chocolate ottoman is a feature piece that goes with the plush textured rug (which gives an island feel around the bed).

Asides from being spoilt for choice in today’s market, you need to decide on what type of property, location, grade, style, age, off-plan or not, use-type and most importantly, ensuring you get it at the right price. If you’re still reading you probably are in this category and we have three easy questions you need to ask yourself. Interpretations of your answers to these questions will help lead you quickly to what you should buy. This is kind of how a doctor asks you a few random questions and then diagnoses your ailment, or simply says you need to rest more.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnyways, first, ask yourself; “what’s my risk appetite?”. You may not be an investment guru, but it’s important to understand that any form of investment or even large purchase such as a personal home has some risk, and there are many types. Two critical risks in investing in property include market risk and liquidity risk. Market risk refers to you being exposed to the performance of your property due to economic factors while liquidity risk infers you the ability of the property to be easily sold to get cash when you need it. The property, in general, is quite illiquid, relative to several other investments (stocks and bonds), but some properties are more illiquid than others. So it’s key to ask yourself, “how much market or liquidity risk am I willing to take?”.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/3-ways-to-invest-in-real-estate-with-less-than-a-million\/\"><strong>Read Also: 3 Ways to Invest in Real Estate with Less than a Million<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\nIf you’re buying off-plan or building yourself, you are exposed to the construction risk or performance risk of the developer or contractor respectively. This is the risk of you investing your funds and the other party not delivering either fully or partially. A lot of people think building themselves guarantees all things, but they are merely opening themselves up to this new risk (construction risk). It often goes south, but it often doesn’t too, if you carefully mitigate this risk by selecting your developer or contractor with insight.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe second question to ask yourself is “what type of return do I want?”. Often people think of real estate as just houses. That’s just one sub-sector (residential). There are several others and each sub-sector typically give different levels of return. In classic textbook fashion, the major types of real estate in ascending order of return (profitability) are agricultural real estate, residential, office, retail, logistics, and hospitality. Again, it does not always work out this way, as some particular properties may outperform their peers, so understand these classifications only as a general rule.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe third question to ask yourself is “what is my preference?” or “what suits me?”. With the two questions above carefully considered, what’s next is to consider what works for you. The age-old adage – different strokes for different folks holds true. For example, due to how much you have, you may only be able to invest in a small retail shop, despite that you would like to buy a personal home in the near future. Or, if you want to tie investments to your children’s future education, you may want to invest in an apartment for each child as against hospitality or logistics which may be less clear cut and liquid. What is essential is to clarify your investment motives and goals, and then choose the best course that suits you in line with your risk and return appetite.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_63898\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"257\"]<img class=\" wp-image-63898\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-ways-to-invest-in-real-estate-with-less-than-a-million-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"257\" height=\"171\" \/> Tayo Odunsi CEO, Northcourt RealEstate<br \/>Tayo.odunsi@northcourtrealestate.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_63900\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"159\"]<img class=\" wp-image-63900\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-ways-to-invest-in-real-estate-with-less-than-a-million-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"159\" height=\"233\" \/> Niyi Olumoto, Brokerage Lead, Northcourt RealEstate<br \/>Niyi.olumoto@northcourtrealestate.com[\/caption]","post_title":"What to buy, when you don’t know what to buy","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"what-to-buy-when-you-dont-know-what-to-buy","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-05-21 05:38:29","post_modified_gmt":"2019-05-21 05:38:29","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=67852","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

Spanning 3 levels with the ground floor consisting of 10 numbers of shops each with a size of 30m2\r\n\r\nThe piazza sets admiralty mall apart from other malls as the piazza acts as a gathering area for social interaction. The first and second floor houses 20-22addittional shops with a minimum size of 30m2.\r\n\r\nThe mall’s major internal feature is the atrium space with a glazed covered rooftop which allows a tunnel of light to link all spaces virtually making the interior a dynamic flow of vertical continuity. This is aimed at allowing the customers to have an experience of light, space, and volume while shopping.\r\n\r\nThe roof deck houses an open terrace restaurant and  lettable office spaces\r\n\r\nThe cantilevered elements of the façade shout out an outlook of attention while serving to shade the glazed shop front.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_67860\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"440\"]<img class=\" wp-image-67860\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/admiralty-mall-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"440\" height=\"293\" \/> 2nd-floor interior shows off the atrium space with a glazed covered rooftop[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_67861\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"434\"]<img class=\" wp-image-67861\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/admiralty-mall-2-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"434\" height=\"289\" \/> Exterior shot shows off the rooftop terraces.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/aluminium-frames-white-or-black\/\"><strong>Read Also: Aluminium Frames: White or Black?<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_67862\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"438\"]<img class=\" wp-image-67862\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/admiralty-mall-3-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"438\" height=\"292\" \/> Social spaces are very important for modern malls[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-67863\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/admiralty-mall-5-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"507\" height=\"284\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeyondarete Architects\r\nGround Floor, Spaco House.\r\n27A Macarthy St, Lagos, Nigeria\r\n\r\n(+234) 8026431691\r\n(+234) 8183569353\r\n\r\n<strong>Email<\/strong><strong>: <\/strong><a href=\"mailto:info@beyondarete.com\">info@beyondarete.com<\/a>","post_title":"The Admiralty Mall","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"the-admiralty-mall","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/aluminium-frames-white-or-black\/","post_modified":"2019-05-21 06:00:06","post_modified_gmt":"2019-05-21 06:00:06","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=67859","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

It is a lady by the sound of the voice I heard”\r\n\r\nWe both pondered on the implications of an expatriate moving into the unoccupied flat of the four flat apartment block where we were both renting in Lekki Phase 1.\r\n\r\n“I hope this does not mean that the Landlord will start charging dollars o, with these <em>oyibo<\/em> tenants” Jimi who always read meanings into the Landlord’s action said.\r\n\r\nBy this time, we had reached the parking lot.

I was exasperated as I had come in just a few hours ago after a great time at a night club. I snuggled deeper under the covers hoping that the argument will stop but instead it grew louder and louder. I could recognise my co-tenant, Sister Kemi’s voice and there was another I could not place. Sister Kemi lives on the ground floor: a fervent Christian, she was always trying to get me to go for one program or the other. Although her evangelism was tiresome, she had a good heart and Jimi and I could count on her for a great meal on demand. I managed to get downstairs and saw Sister Kemi, who is not often agitated, raising her against another Lady who affected a ‘speak to the hand’ attitude. This was the new tenant. Her name was Sandra (call me Sandy) and she looked and sounded like an American, although she said she was Nigerian. I got involved. The cause of the conflict was simple: Sister Kemi had an all-night prayer session and Sandy was unhappy that she was kept up all night.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/over-2500-flats-houses-office-spaces-to-let\/\"><strong>Read Also: Over 2,500 Flats, Houses Office Spaces to Let<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\n“Don’t you want prayers?” Sister Kemi was nonplussed at a Nigerian who could stand against the Lord’s anointed.  “The previous tenants were fine with my prayer sessions and used to send me prayer requests”.\r\n\r\nBut Sandy went off about her constitutional rights to sleep etc and that she would take up the matter with the ‘authorities’. I managed to make peace between both of them and then was treated to the spectacle of two ladies bouncing off and slamming their respective front doors.\r\n\r\nOver the next few weeks, Sandy and Sister Kemi clashed repeatedly over things that Sandy said ‘infringed on her right to happiness in her abode”. She was unhappy that Sister Kemi took too much space on the washing line, kept her stuff in the common areas, and had a prayer meeting in the house and so on. Jimi was not spared when one of his visitors parked in Sandy’s parking slot. Wiggling her finger under Jimi’s nose, she told him off in no uncertain terms.\r\n\r\nI managed to keep out of Sandy’s way until……………\r\n\r\nConclusion of the story next week","post_title":"My Aje Butter Co-Tenant!","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"my-aje-butter-co-tenant","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-05-21 06:11:28","post_modified_gmt":"2019-05-21 06:11:28","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=67867","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

To break up the monotony, each block is subtly differentiated with the interplay of the front balconies and use of pale colours.\r\n\r\nMost of the car parking spaces are zoned to the front to reduce vehicular activities at the heart of the site; and almost by default the service building occupies a small area in front of the site for quick access.\r\n\r\nIn an already used up site, pockets of green areas wrap around the main building to ensure there are break-out spaces within the site where residents can enjoy outdoor\r\nactivities at the ground level. To give distinction to each apartment, the terrace units\r\nare “stacked” next to one another with vertical grooves separating them while the flats are stacked horizontally on top of each other across four floors.\r\n\r\nA typical terrace apartment measures at 317sqm and features a single car garage, a steward’s room, laundry, a store and an ante-room on the ground floor. The living\r\nroom, dining area and the kitchen occupy first floor and the bedrooms, four in number, are on the second and third floor. The flats measure at 177Sq.M each with the exception of the ground floor flat at 132Sq.M.

Sandy was an ‘American-Nigerian’ by accent and behaviour and no sooner had she moved into the vacant flat in the block of four flats that I reside in, than she had issues with my other two co-tenants. (see www.castles.com. ng for Part 1 of this story).\r\n\r\nI had managed to keep out of  Sandy’s path as I had a major project at the office which meant that I worked till very late at night and left first thing in the morning. Some days I slept in the office. At long last, the project was over and I prepared for a nice evening before the TV catching up with the programmes I had set my DSTV to record. I was just lamenting how my team, Arsenal FC had thrown away a two goal lead when I had a sharp rap on my door. I opened to see Sandra looking very irate. <u>“It’s disturbing my feng shui”. I was completely lost – was she talking about Chinese food?<\/u>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/my-aje-butter-co-tenant\/\"><strong>Read Also: My Aje Butter Co-Tenant! Part 1<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\nIt took a lot of explanation on her part to make me understand that my DSTV dish was affecting ‘her spiritual’ balance anytime she practiced yoga on her balcony. ‘Yoga’? Feng shui’?  This girl had totally lost in the United States where I presumed that she had lived for many years. I tried to explain to her that the dish could only be in that spot to receive signals and that it had been there well before she moved in. When she started talking about good neighborliness and lack of consideration on my part, I lost it. I angrily told her in my best American accent to get off my property and that I was within my rights to affect her feng shui, yoga or whatever. She stomped off angrily. Then began the war of attrition as Sandra did all she could to annoy me. If I sent the <em>Mai guard <\/em>on an errand she would call the agent and complain. If a few people come over to watch football in my flat, she would insist that they should not park in the compound.\r\n\r\nThis continued for a few months until Sandy’s mother came to stay. We did not know she was Sandy’s mother – the wizened old village woman asking for ‘Chinwe’ definitely could not be mother to the globetrotting Sandy who very possibly was on first name terms with the American First Lady and many of the British Royal family? But she was. Sandy, sorry Chinwe went on her knees to greet <em>Mama. <\/em>Before long the pungent smell of stockfish and other native cooking came wafting from Sandra’s flat. Now cooking smells were a constant peeve’s of Sandra and she had told everyone off in the flat whenever she perceived a hint of such smells. So Sis Kemi, Jimi, (the other two tenants) and I made a beeline for Sandra’s flat. We were going to tell her off. Sandra opened the door, acute embarrassment written all over her face. “Are those the neighbours? Invite them in for a proper village meal” the old lady appeared behind Sandy. We all trooped in to enjoy one of the proper <em>naija <\/em>meals ever with Sandy eating with her fingers like the rest of us.\r\n\r\nSuffice to say that after Mama left, there were no more Americanisms from Chinwe (sorry Sandra)!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"My Aje Butter Co-Tenant (2)","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"my-aje-butter-co-tenant-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/my-aje-butter-co-tenant\/","post_modified":"2019-05-27 09:36:17","post_modified_gmt":"2019-05-27 09:36:17","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=68103","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

This is an individual who loves to manage clients, bounce multi-figure ideas among similar minds, as well as entertain casual guests when the need calls for it. He is the task-juggler-cum-high-achiever who likes his ducks in a row and appointments synced with his business calendar. Just the way a brilliant mind operates!\r\n\r\nThe zoning of this home is a mix of openness and a tint of privacy - with the master bedroom being completely off-limits. Just the way this expert juggler likes it!\r\n\r\nA look at the floor layout gives away the openness of the plan. There is minimal use of walls; the spaces graciously flow into one another, while the outdoor terraces are brought to life with dotted planters. The brilliance of the apartment comes together in a fierce composition with patterns, whites, textures and shades of grey dominating this home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-68115\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/03-THENEST_TANGO_DS02_LIVINGROOM-02-300x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"383\" \/>\r\n\r\nA closer look from this view gives a sense of calm and peace which pervades within this home. The front terrace can be opened up to allow a flood of warm sunlight which visually enhances the size and ambiance of the living room. This is wonderful, especially during an evening of entertainment when he has a handful of guests who love to clink half-full glasses of Moet &amp; Chandon and make casual talk about the future of Blockchain technology. “Here’s a toast to digital gold investments!”\r\n\r\nSoft tones and textures are used prevalently, and the powder room is tucked inconspicuously into the corner; guaranteeing utmost privacy. Valiant pride lingers in this living space; it’s certainly a home to remember.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-68116\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/05-THENEST_TANGO_DS02_STUDY-LIVINGROOM-300x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"424\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe walls of this living area are a work of art, distinct in character and with a sense of harmony that is mind-blowing. The pristine nature of the white sofa with the colours of the throw pillows is classic. The hazel-wood wall colour right behind magnificently complements it. The choice of the brisk frame edges for the brilliant photography collections gives away the selective nature of this host. The spotlights draw attention to this. Soft wood tones of the TV console, centre table, wall niche and dining cabinet just warms up the place introducing an alluring coziness into the space.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-68117\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/04-THENEST_TANGO_DS02_LIVINGROOM-01-300x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"375\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe living area is dominated with shades of beige, warm wood tones, and textures in visually satisfying unison. There’s a glorious interplay of lighting as it bounces off the textured surfaces. The large windows throw in copious amounts of sunlight, giving this home a theatrical feel.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe brick accent wall for the TV is a focal point and the goodness overflows into the adjoining wall in the study\/home-office to maintain a sense of wholeness in the entire open plan layout; this accent wall is superbly matched with the light wood colour of the home-office furniture. The different patterns of the center rugs demarcate each space subtly, creating a visual island for the different spatial functions.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/modern-room-partitioning-ideas\/\"><strong>Readl Also: Modern Room Partitioning Ideas<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-68118\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/06-THENEST_TANGO_DS02_STUDY-01-300x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"467\" height=\"389\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe uniqueness of this neat home-office is in the choice of furniture; the grey cotton sofa adds just the right dash of fabric to this space. The long and flowing window drapes further keep things cozy here. The soft white of midday sun unrestrained, bursts through the large windows. The grey sofa helps to maintain the atmosphere of business while the wall painting and brick accent wall adds a touch of class and warmth; this space is a “workstation” for high achievement!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-68119\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/07-THENEST_TANGO_DS02_KITCHEN-01bjpg-300x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"472\" height=\"393\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe kitchen is well organized with unique shelving and compartments. The wood-themed lower cabinets are the perfect backdrop for the upper white cabinets with the added two step wood ledge which enhances the layout. The kitchen-dining combo allows an open-air interaction between guests of the home and the business professional who at this time has assumes the role of a private <em>chef<\/em>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe subtle white brick backsplash provides a cohesive look to the entire kitchen-dining ensemble and together with the open nature of the design, creates the illusion of a wide space; perfect for cooking up an exotic dish of <em>semovita<\/em> and<em> efo riro!<\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-68123\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/09-THENEST_TANGO_DS02_KITCHEN-02c-300x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"360\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe double-door refrigerator is housed in a unique wall unit with extra neat storage above it; the light wood pantry beside it with open and closed sections is a perfect flourish.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-68122\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/10-THENEST_TANGO_DS02_MASTER-BEDROOM-01-300x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"485\" height=\"404\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe closet of this bedroom spans almost the entire wall facing the master bed and is organized to accommodate a TV wall unit with drawers below, swing doors on the side and above with textured plain white fronts. The two step picture ledges at the corner is a cool detail which rhymes with the soft wood colour of the wardrobe plinth.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-68121\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/10-THENEST_TANGO_DS02_MASTER-BEDROOM-02-300x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"466\" height=\"388\" \/>\r\n\r\nA line of wooden dresser with a narrow mirror is neatly positioned at a corner where it is truly functional; the red markers on the grey plush rug add the dash of colour that this space needs to pop. Modern glass globe bedside lamps with polished black steel frames stand majestically on either side of the bed like two elegant art collections on display.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-68120\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/11-THENEST_TANGO_DS02_BATHROOM-300x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"473\" height=\"394\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn the master bathroom, the white vanity of the wash hand basin blends with the white frame of the mirror above it. This is a brilliant idea and the greyish-white texture of the marble floor and walls provides a soothing neutral backdrop which makes for a smooth start to each day. The pattern created by the stretcher bond can hardly be missed. The bathroom is simple, yet visually intriguing!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong> <\/strong><strong>FOOTNOTE:<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe  <strong><em>TANGO Design Scheme 2<\/em><\/strong> is a scheme under the <strong><em>TANGO<\/em><\/strong> house-type (2 Bedroom Apartment) in Nest Homes  on-going Abijo Development.

{"ID":"68444","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-13 08:17:39","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-13 08:17:39","post_content":"If we received just one hundred Naira for each time a client asked “Which is better and cheaper – should I buy or build a house?”, we would have earned well over a million Naira. Thinking of it, this question is actually worth millions. But on the surface, it should be cheaper to build a house as against buying. This is because the alternative to the building would be to buy from a developer or reseller, who would have included a profit margin, thereby making it more expensive than the cost of the building. But this is often not the case, in fact, it seldom is. In this article, we will share a few reasons why it may be better to buy a house than to build and also share the scenarios where it is better to build over buying. While this information may help you assess your situation and determine which category you find yourself, it is advisable that you engage a professional real estate advisor to conduct a “make or buy analysis” on your behalf if you’re in this particular bind.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/what-to-buy-when-you-dont-know-what-to-buy\/\"><strong>Read Also: What to Buy When you Don't Know What to Buy<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\nOne primary scenario where buying may be better and cheaper than the building is in the case where you lack construction expertise. Constructing a property is a multifaceted endeavor requiring a myriad of skills ranging from design, quantities costing, building to construction project management. Should you lack these skills, you may over-pay, demand or procure low quality or unduly prolong the project. You may also have to arm yourself with one too many consultants which are likely to increase the project costs because you don’t have any technical skills.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn many cases, multi-unit or multi-project developers and builders enjoy economies of scale which pushes their costs and turn around time down. This way, their per unit cost is often lower than when a user wants to build one or few of the same property type.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnother reason it may be better to buy is when there is panic selling or a recessionary economy. In downturns, inflation is high so the cost of building materials go up, however people are in need of cash and willing to sell lower so property prices come down. This leaves a mismatch between built property prices and the cost of building new ones. It becomes significantly cheaper to buy an existing property than to build a new one. This is also the case when a property is on the market on a forced sale from a bank or financier. The property is often sold lower than its replacement cost.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHowever, it becomes cheaper and better to build over buying when the property in question is to be specialized property. Developers often only have standard properties for sale. If a major specialty is required in a property, it is cheaper and faster to build over buying and then remodeling. Remodeling costs can quickly spiral out of control especially when structural alterations need to be done.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlso, it is most likely cheaper for a construction savvy user to build over buying. His expertise not only reduces wastage, but it is also a cost input that s\/he does not have to pay for in cash. It works out as sweat equity.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFinally, it becomes better and cheaper to build in a booming or bullish economy. In such an economy property prices are on the rise and expectedly more profitable, allowing for any wastage even a first-time self-builder may incur. The building is also more desirable over buying when the entire construction sum is not available and the project will be executed in piecemeal. Piecemeal projects tend to be longer and more expensive, however, they have a significant and unassailable advantage, in that it reduces the entry barrier to property ownership.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBy\r\n\r\nTayo Odunsi CEO, Northcourt Real Estate\r\n\r\nTayo.odunsi@northcourtrealestate.com\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nNiyi Olumoto, Brokerage Lead, Northcourt Real Estate\r\n\r\n<a href=\"mailto:Niyi.olumoto@northcourtrealestate.com\">Niyi.olumoto@northcourtrealestate.com<\/a>","post_title":"Building: To Buy or To Build by Tayo Odunsi","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"to-buy-or-to-build","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/amcon-sells-petroleum-products-tank-farms\/","post_modified":"2019-06-13 08:28:49","post_modified_gmt":"2019-06-13 08:28:49","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=68444","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Don’t get us wrong, we are not saying that Nigerians do not bathe but that they do not run water into bathtubs and then linger in the water for several minutes. What they typically do to get clean is to put water in a bucket, lather their bodies with soap and then rinse off by drawing the water from the bucket with a smaller bowl. Those lucky to have flowing water, take showers. In either situation, what is required is a defined bathing area rather than a bathtub. But doesn’t a defined bathing area cum shower stall look a bit, well, bush?

The landmark development overlooking Buffalo Bayou Park will stand as a crossroads between downtown, the Galleria-Uptown area, Midtown and the Texas Medical Center offering the best of the city and outdoor lifestyle.\r\n\r\n“The Allen will truly be a landmark project –redefining luxury living, working and playing at the middle meeting point between the central business district and the Galleria,” said Acho Azuike, COO and Managing Director of Houston EB5.\r\n\r\nAs the fourth largest city in the United States, Houston is the nation’s demographic future with more than 145 languages spoken and consistently ranked as the most diverse city in the US. Houston is home to the second most Fortune 1000 companies in the country, second only to New York City. International trade directly or indirectly supports one-third of all jobs in the Houston metropolitan area. Houston counts the largest Nigerian population outside of Nigeria, making Houston home to the largest Nigerian community in the US.\r\n\r\nHouston EB5, a subsidiary of DC Partners (an award-winning real estate developer), is an approved Regional Center by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services since 2010. Houston EB5 provides foreign investors the opportunity to obtain Permanent Residency (Green Card) in the United States through a qualified real estate investment.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAzuike said The Allen fits perfectly with 3Invest’s profile for high-quality EB5 investment funding. Like previous Houston EB5 projects, The Allen has received great support from the City of Houston. A Targeted Employment Area “TEA” designation has been assigned to the project, lowering the minimum investment amount from $1 million to $500,000.\r\n\r\n“Through the marketing of previous projects and local partners like 3Invest, Houston EB5 has established strong investor pipelines in Latin America, Africa, and Asia helping assure complete capitalization of projects,” said Azuike.\r\n\r\nTo date, Houston EB5 has raised over $125 million in foreign investments.\r\n\r\n“Because of 3Invest’s success in Nigeria with previous Houston EB5 projects, we are now looking to grow our partnership with Houston EB5 by expanding our investor reach into Ghana, where we are certain many investors would like to take advantage of these immigrant investment opportunities for their families.” Ruth Obih, CEO, 3Invest.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-invisible-lightswitch-socket-range\/\"><strong>Read Also: The Invisible Lightswitch &amp; Socket Range<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\nWith more than 30 years of real estate experience, Houston EB5 works to develop high-quality residential high-rise, mid-rise, mixed-use and suburban projects. Houston EB5 gives the opportunity to foreign nationals to receive Permanent Residency 'Green Card' for themselves and their immediate family through a qualified real estate investment.\r\n\r\n“Houston EB5 has a proven success rate of Green Card approvals and return of capital to all its investors,” said Roberto Contreras, President &amp; CEO Houston EB5. “We consistently deliver world-class investment projects and demonstrate long-term financial strength, as we help investors achieve their business and residency goals.”\r\n\r\nHouston EB5 investors share in the project’s profits and receive an Annual Preferred Return in addition to the full return of their initial investment. Moreover, Houston EB5 offers its investors a simple and safe exit through the sale or refinance of the project.\r\n\r\nHouston EB5 provides a highly personalized and boutique-like experience to its investors during the EB-5 visa process. Obtaining a Green Card through the EB-5 visa program allows investors to enjoy similar benefits as U.S. citizens, excluding the right to vote and run for government office.\r\n\r\nHouston EB5 has stayed committed to bringing developments of impeccable design and elegance to Houston and San Antonio, and to sustaining the strong economic environment from which the cities have grown. Given that real estate investments remain much safer in nature than typical business investments, compounded with the strong economies of Houston and San Antonio, participants in Houston EB5 projects can expect a more reliable, timely return on their investments.\r\n\r\nParties interested in the EB-5 investment opportunity presented by The Allen can make further inquiries regarding project details on how to proceed by contacting 3Invest, the project’s industry partner in West Africa.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Parties interested in the EB-5 investment opportunity presented by The Allen can make further inquiries regarding project details how to proceed by contacting 3INVEST, the project’s industry partner in West Africa.<\/strong>\r\n<strong>Email – houstoneb5@3invest.co<\/strong>\r\n<strong>Call - +234 8099001100<\/strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"The Allen Offers a Unique Opportunity","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"the-allen-houston-offers-a-unique-opportunity","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-invisible-lightswitch-socket-range\/","post_modified":"2019-06-13 11:59:38","post_modified_gmt":"2019-06-13 11:59:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=68501","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

The Tenant Fees Act, banning Landlords and agents from charging letting fees paid to tenants in the private rented sector and caps tenancy deposits in England to 5 weeks where annual rent is below £50,000.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the Act is to reduce the costs that tenants face at the outset, and throughout a tenancy and is part of a wider package of measures aimed at rebalancing the relationship between tenants and landlords to deliver a fairer, good quality and more affordable private rented sector.\r\n\r\nTenants will be able to see, at a glance, what a given property will cost them in the advertised rent with no hidden costs. The party that contracts the service – the landlord – will be responsible for paying for the service, which will help to ensure that the fees charged reflect the real economic value of the services provided and sharpen letting agents’ incentive to compete for landlords’ business.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-desea-golden-touch-by-gufram\/\"><strong>Read Also: The Deséa Golden Touch by Gufram – Coffee Machine<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\nLandlords and their agents will be unable to charge anything not exempted, that the tenant is required to pay as a condition ‘of the grant, renewal, continuance, variation, assignment, novation or termination of’ an assured shorthand tenant, or license agreement. This includes payments to third parties, either for service rendered throughout the tenancy or for specific performance of a job and third-party loans. Rules around deposits and how they are dealt with, will also be significantly tightened.\r\n\r\nThere will be a ban on setting rent at a higher level for the first portion of the tenancy and then dropping it down, afterwards. This is to prevent landlords or agents trying to offset the ban on fees by artificially increasing the rent for the initial period to make up the costs. A higher rent than you would normally charge for the property, which is consistent throughout the tenancy will however be fine.\r\n\r\nHolding deposits - the commitment fee tenant pay when renting a property - will be limited to a maximum of 1 week’s rent and subject to statutory legislation on the repayment of this should the tenancy not proceed.\r\n\r\nDamages to property caused by the tenant’s breach of tenancy, such as cleaning cost for the property at the end of the tenancy will still be deductible from the deposit; as well as other default fees, you’ll still be able to charge if the tenant loses their keys or is late paying the rent. A landlord can also still charge for changes to the tenancy requested by the tenant or early termination of tenancy.\r\n\r\nExamples of banned fees are:\r\n\r\n* Credit checks\r\n\r\n* Referencing\r\n\r\n* Inventories\r\n\r\n* Charging for a guarantor form\r\n\r\n* Cleaning services\r\n\r\n* Professional cleaning\r\n\r\n* Having the property de-flea as a condition of allowing pets in the property\r\n\r\n* Admin Charges\r\n\r\n* Requirements to have specific insurance providers\r\n\r\n* Gardening services\r\n\r\nWhat does this all mean for you the Landlord?\r\nSome of the tenant fees goes towards important things like reference and credit checks, to ensure good quality tenants are the ones you hand keys over to and other bits of it to things like inventory checks, which creates an audit trail of the building’s condition, before and after the tenant moves in\/out. Thus these aren’t costs that can be forgone. 57% of Landlords surveyed in research by the Residential Landlord association indicated a willingness to raise their rents to cover increased charges.\r\n\r\nIt is important to work with an agent that can minimize the impact of these changes on your earnings and makes sure your portfolio isn’t left exposed.\r\n\r\nFor a non-obligatory conversation on this topic and other Landlord - Tenant matters, get in touch with us today\r\nemail: citymgt@dfint.com\r\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7713 0909","post_title":"The London Landlord and the Tenant Fees Act","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"the-london-landlord-and-the-tenant-fees-act","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-06-13 12:45:18","post_modified_gmt":"2019-06-13 12:45:18","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=68513","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

These questions and many more are what smart home technology can answer for you. From home monitoring systems to light and sound control; smart home technology has just begun to scratch the surface of what is possible in the construction Industry. “The Sixtus” (4 units of terrace duplexes and 2 units detached houses at Lekki Phase 1 in Lagos, Nigeria) a project by Joe Etoniru &amp; Associates is a showpiece of such technology.\r\n\r\n<strong>Safety &amp; Security:<\/strong> Every home has some form of safety system no matter how rudimentary it might be. From the kind of locks used on the doors to whether or not a burglar bars should be placed on the windows and other openings. In the case of an automated home, there is the opportunity to take this up a notch. First, you can get a smart lock that reduces the need for the use of keys especially in cases where strangers have to access the home for various reasons. With most smart locks, you can create a code specifically for a person to use which can be deactivated once the person is done with their assigned task. The closed circuit door camera that takes pictures of everyone who presses your doorbell or was at your door while you were away is another ingenious way to protect your home against unwanted guests or track who has visited your home and at what time.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-london-landlord-and-the-tenant-fees-act\/\"><strong>Read Also: The London Landlord and the Tenant Fees Act<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Home Controls:<\/strong> Home control systems like <strong><em>Amazon Echo, Alexa, Siri <\/em><\/strong>and<strong><em> Google Home<\/em><\/strong>, provide convenient and safe ways to control your lights, blinds, garage door and more. With these control systems, your entire home can be automated to give you access to all home appliances from anywhere in the world using smartphones, laptops or other mobile devices.  For example, while you are away, you can control your TV and place parental control on what your children can watch at any point in time. Smart devices like <em>Amazon Echo Show<\/em> allows you make video calls, set wake up modes, leave a message on the system for your spouse or children and sing lullabies to your children without being physically present. With the recent heat wave in Nigeria, you can automate the Air conditioning in your home to come on at a specific time in desired areas of the house from the comfort of your phone.\r\n\r\nThe wide range of existing SMART home technology gives prospective home owners the advantage of prioritizing which smart home functionalities they want in their homes as early as the design and build stage. “The Sixtus” presents and opportunity for the discerning homeowner to determine how smart he wants his home to be.\r\n\r\nCONTACTS\r\n\r\nJoe Etoniru &amp; Associates\r\n\r\n9, Olawale Cole Onitiri\r\nLekki Phase I\r\n\r\n+2348082163583\r\ninfo@joetoniruest.com\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"The SMART Home in Lekki Phase 1 by Joe Etoniru","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"the-smart-home-in-lekki-phase-1","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/the-london-landlord-and-the-tenant-fees-act\/","post_modified":"2019-06-13 13:09:27","post_modified_gmt":"2019-06-13 13:09:27","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=68518","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

Nowadays, many companies produce furniture internally equipped with boxes and rotors for watches, but they are tied to a gross and heavy look, revealing themselves incompatible with luxurious furnishings. The absence of the safes' necessary emergency mechanisms, barely lined compartments, the presence of rotors coming from Countries outside Europe, it's what most of the market has to offer, and which we shy away from. Nobody realizes safes inserted into fine wood furniture, directly placeable in your bedrooms. Nobody gives you the chance to have always at your fingertips the luxury you love to surround with. This is the reason why Agresti products are born: because the uncomfortable safes located in the basement, the steel blocks hidden in furniture, the banks' strongboxes will be for you just a memory.”\r\n\r\nThey take such a strong stance on security that one cannot even download a catalogue from their site, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.agresti.com\">www.agresti.com<\/a>, without getting a password from the company.

This is about the actual size of the entire Eko Atlantic City itself! Perhaps the writers and their editors can be excused for such exaggeration because of the seismic implications of the transaction. The agreement between the United States Embassy in Nigeria and South Energyx Nigeria Limited, for the purchase of land for the site of a new American Consulate office complex in Lagos signed in May 2019 will come to be seen as one of the bellwether events in the life of the project.\r\n\r\nAlthough the actual size has been put at around 50,000 square meters (five hectares of land), the publicity coup of getting such an important institution as a US Consulate is massive – as attested to by the overwhelming media interest in the transaction. Also, the inference from the sale is that the US Government has confidence in the security, infrastructure, and viability of Eko Atlantic. United States Consul General, John Bray said during the signing ceremony “Eko Atlantic was selected for its world-class infrastructure.  Purchase of land for a new Consulate General will ensure we can continue to work with Nigerians to provide opportunities for economic growth and development in Lagos.” This will draw companies and other institutions to see Eko Atlantic as a preferred location for their business and this, in turn, will drive interest in residential apartments.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/a-new-idea-of-safe-by-agresti\/\"><strong>Read Also: Decoration\/Luxury: A New Idea of Safe by Agresti<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\nBut will these apartments be competitively priced in terms of sales prices and rents?  Eko Atlantic is not only about luxury and high priced apartments.

While the city will naturally feature a range of high-end luxury apartments, it also houses many opportunities for more competitively-priced accommodation.”  When <em>Highbrow Living<\/em> spoke with Ron Chagoury Jr  (Ron Jr), the Vice Chairman of South Energyx Nigeria Limited in February this year, he explained that Eko Atlantic is for innovative developers. This is a blank canvass for developers to come up with projects to meet market demand and a segment of that demand is for competitively priced apartments. ‘What we have done in Eko Atlantic is to remove all the hindrances for the developer and give him an opportunity to push the envelope in terms of concept and design.\r\n\r\nArkland Properties &amp; Investment Co. Ltd, privately owned real estate firm, with over 115 developed apartments . in Lagos, Abuja, and Turkey, has taken up the challenge with its exciting A &amp;A  Tower Project in Eko Atlantic City. A &amp; A Tower, designed by the renowned Turkish architect Atilla Ilhan, is a development located in the Ocean Front District of Eko Atlantic  City. It consists of two and three bedroom homes, as well as shops and offices.\r\n\r\nA &amp; A Tower has all the facilities and luxuries that come with a high-spec apartment block:  recreation facilities like gyms, cafes, and restaurants as well as a landscaped promenade directly adjacent to the ocean. But what will be extremely interesting to investors and future homeowners is the price point. We have been told by the developers that going prices for the two and three bedroom apartments will be commensurate to mid-range apartments prices in Ikoyi. This could be as much as 40% of prices of similar apartments in Eko Atlantic City.  According to JIDE OLUMODIMU,  MD\/CEO  Arkland Properties &amp; Investment Co. Ltd, A &amp; A Tower will be at the top end in terms of finishing and furnishings but will be competitively priced to attract those whom ordinarily would be priced out of Eko Atlantic City.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n2019 may well turn out as the year the rush for Eko Atlantic City apartments turns into a stampede. With the siting of the US Consulate in the enclave and competitively priced apartments offers like those in A &amp; A Tower, the promise of luxury with first class infrastructure and the lovely views of the Atlantic Ocean has become an affordable reality.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nContacts:\r\n\r\nARKLAND PROPERTIES &amp; INVESTMENTS\r\n\r\n<a href=\"tel:08139522288\"><strong>+(234) 813 952 2288, 08090652055<\/strong><\/a>, <a href=\"tel:08139522288\"><strong>08090652054, 08090652056, 08090652057<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/mail.google.com\/mail\/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=%20contact@arklandproperties.com\">contact@arklandproperties.com<\/a>","post_title":"Latest Developments in Eko Atlantic City","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"latest-developments-in-eko-atlantic-city","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/castles.com.ng\/a-new-idea-of-safe-by-agresti\/","post_modified":"2019-06-13 14:43:50","post_modified_gmt":"2019-06-13 14:43:50","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=68533","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Below are the facts of the matter to further corroborate our position.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-69789 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/5d19fff69d778.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"490\" height=\"348\" \/>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>As far back as 2003 some of us bought into Victory Park Estate land to develop our houses after doing our due legal diligence and confirming at the Lagos State Land registry that the title to the land that is in the name of <strong>Knight Rook Limited<\/strong> was free from any encumbrance. The legal interpretation of this was that the title was good, no mortgage, pledge, charge etc that had been obtained against it by any financial institution or any other company. From 2003 till about June 2017, the present homeowners in the estate continued to buy into the estate and also developed, living in the estate without molestation by anyone, either government or otherwise paying their Land Use Charge to Lagos State annually after having our various titles to our properties registered.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-69787 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/NEW-ADVERT-RATE1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"704\" height=\"444\" \/><\/li>\r\n \t<li>To our amazement in June 2017, we all woke up to see a publication that Knight Rook Limited, the owner of the global C of O over Victory Park Estate was in Receivership with other companies over a loan one of the companies Grant Properties Limited allegedly took from Sterling Bank, Skye bank now Polaris bank, Wema bank and FCMB and used Knight Rook Limited with its shares as security that the companies have defaulted in paying while the said loan, now an eligible bank assets was subsequently sold to AMCON in 2011 or 2012.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>So it was AMCON that went to court to put the companies in Receivership.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>We gathered that following the suit filed by AMCON, the shareholders of Knight Rook Limited as security for the facility, transferred their shares to the nominees of the banks and resigned their positions as directors in Knight Rook Limited relinquishing their right to continue to act as directors of Knight Rook Limited. Interestingly, we discovered that the Awosedo's family who owned the companies continued to act to the knowledge of the banks and they (the banks) never stopped them from acting despite not being directors of Knight Rook Limited anymore which according to them, a change in that direction was effected at the Corporate Affairs Commission in Abuja.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nDespite the removal of the Awosedo's from Knight Rook Limited, an agreement was entered by the banks with the other company of the Awosedo's; Grant Properties Limited to market and sell all the land in Victory Park Estate and remit sales proceeds to the banks which to the knowledge or active collaboration by these banks, the Awosedo's again defaulted without the bank doing anything and even AMCON after they purchased the asset. This agreement between the banks and the Awosedo's companies was made in 2006. So from 2006 until AMCON’s publication of putting the companies in receivership, members of the public were misled by the Awosedo's, the banks and AMCON to believe that the Awosedos have a right to the land in Victory Park estate held in the name of Knight Rook Limited.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-69788 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/5d19ffa3ed2c9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"497\" height=\"353\" \/>\r\n\r\n<strong>THIS IS HOW THINGS STAND PRESENTLY<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWith the receivership by AMCON of Knight Rook Limited and by virtue of assets of Knight Rook Limited, AMCON is now laying claim to all the land in Victory Park Estate whether already sold and developed years ago or not and have continued to harass innocent bonafide purchasers without notice of their interest. They have filed several suits against the Awosedo's companies in court whereby some magic since the companies are in receivership, Knight Rook Limited admitted in court that it is indebted to AMCON and a consent judgment was made in that regard against Knight Rook Limited. These suits were filed by AMCON without joining any of the homeowners in any of the suits but have turned around to use the judgment in those suits to take over the properties of homeowners in the estate.\r\n\r\nOn our part, on being aware of the suits and the attempt of the Receiver Manager appointed by the court on behalf of AMCON, we have taken steps to go through due legal process to challenge the right of AMCON to interfere with our possession but unfortunately, for eighteen months, nothing has been done and AMCON and its RM have continued to make life unbearable for us as they are not only taking over unoccupied and undeveloped properties, but even the ones in occupation, people are being forced out by the use of thugs and police!\r\n\r\nJust yesterday, (Wednesday 25th June 2019) two families were forced out of their houses and their properties sealed by court officials acting on these judgments obtained against the Awosedo's companies.\r\n\r\nWe have also written petition letters to the Presidency, the Inspector General of Police office, the Lagos State Commissioner of Police and even the board and management of AMCON, yet no respite.\r\n\r\nWe have heard, but refuse to believe that that the Inspector General of Police and the Presidency actually approved the actions of AMCON against us innocent law-abiding people who never took any loan from any bank to buy property in Victory Park Estate and therefore defaulted in paying. Pursuant to the above, it leaves a sour taste in the moth to see that the Awosedos, the banks, and even AMCON officials who committed and orchestrated this shameful fraud on our economy and us are left to enjoy their loot whilst we suffer no reason. Members of the public will be shocked that out of pure frustration, a family within the estate has started making plans to relocate to another country within the next few days!\r\n\r\nFinally, we are making a passionate appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari, the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, the Inspector General of Police, and the leadership of AMCON to place a premium on the current administration’s anti-corruption mantra and right these wrongs by calling AMCON to order.\r\n\r\nIt is a complete travesty of justice that ordinary Nigerians like us are treated like sub-humans and strangers in our own land and in a country governed by a democratically elected government.\r\n\r\nTHIS INJUSTICE MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO STAND!\r\n\r\n<strong>Signed<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Concerned Residents of Victory Park Estate<\/strong>","post_title":"Victory Park Estate: Residents Seek Justice, Call On Presidency To Call Amcon To Order","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"victory-park-estate-residents-seek-justice-call-on-presidency-to-call-amcon-to-order","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-07-02 09:46:52","post_modified_gmt":"2019-07-02 09:46:52","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=69783","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The key benefits of this approach is that a thorough coating of a foundation not only prevents water from ingress into the building interior, it also protects the main elements of the foundation from deterioration due to passage of water\/moisture into it thereby helping to maintain its structural integrity throughout the building’s life span .\r\n\r\nFoundation coatings are usually made from bitumen and asphalt but together with other admixtures. These two materials are known to possess the functional requirement of limiting passage of moisture through them. Foundation coat is a chemical mix that normally comes in gelatinous or pure liquid forms at room temperatures.\r\n\r\nCoating of foundation is usually done during the construction process but occasionally, on post-construction maintenance. This approach is not really complex but requires due diligence during application. Unlike the use of damp-proofing membranes\/sheets which are only placed in foundation or extended walls and laid over floors to prevent water from rising above into the interior area of the building, foundation coating are usually applied over the whole surface area of the interior and exterior sides of the foundation walls up to the ground or basement floor. It is relatively difficult to coat a foundation when the building has already been built but it is not impossible. There is also difficulty when coating foundations that are submerged in ground water; dewatering action would apply exclusively in such cases before further action.\r\n\r\nIn applying coating on foundations, here are some simple steps;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Clean up the surfaces to be coated with clothing materials, brushes and other suitable tools. They should be free from grits, loose particles, protrusions and unwanted bulges.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Fill up voids and close or line up cracks with suitable admixtures.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>If the concrete has not cured and surface coating must be done due to construction timelines or other reasons, you may be required to use a suitable primer or membrane before applying the coat.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Follow the manufacturer’s instructions on how to use their product. Some products will require that you apply directly without including any other mix while others will require the opposite.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Spray the solution onto the surface of the foundation up to ground floor using a spray painting machine or by the use of paint brush. Ensure the mix forms a thick even coat on the surface to ensure several layers of protection from moisture effect.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Then leave to dry.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nPrecautions must be taken to protect your eyes and body skin from exposure to chemicals as this is dangerous. Also minimized wastage by avoiding over-concentrated spraying – i.e. spraying so many content on one spot.\r\n\r\nFoundation coating in Nigeria will cost some N8,000 per sqm depending largely on the product used. There are at least 10 known brands in the Nigerian market today but their use is largely common with commercial, industrial and other non-residential facilities. However it can be used in any kind of building and other earth-laid infrastructure. Most of the available products are imported and there is need for massive local production to check cost. When you are embarking on a building project in areas susceptible to rising damp, flooding etc., foundation coating is a sure way to stop moisture from making a mess of your investment or space or as the case may be.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Osaz’ ENOBAKHARE is a young Contractor and the CEO of Heavens Contractors Ltd with over 40 successfully completed projects across Nigeria and elsewhere. <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Phone: <\/strong>08167394799\r\n\r\n<strong>Mail: <\/strong>osaz@heavenscontractors.com\r\n\r\n<strong>Blog: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.engineerosaz.blogpot.com\">www.engineerosaz.blogpot.com<\/a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Web: <\/strong>www.heavenscontractors.com","post_title":"How to Damp-Proof a Building by Foundation Coating","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"how-to-damp-proof-a-building-by-foundation-coating","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-07-07 14:27:17","post_modified_gmt":"2019-07-07 14:27:17","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=69801","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

A typical roof system will normally consist of the roof beam, the roof carcass, the roof covering, roof appendages (e.g. parapet) and the roof drain (see figure). While the roof beam and carcass are designed to provide the required structural support to the entire roof, the roof covering and drains are the exposed members that receive the rainwater over the entire surface area of the building and keep it away.      <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are various roof types classified largely according to their design patterns or shapes as well as the materials used in their construction. The common roof types include Gable roofs which basically slopes in two opposite directions all along its stretch. Hipped roofs<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which typically slope in four direction -two each at opposite ends. There are also the Monopitch roofs which as the name implies slopes in one direction only. Scatter roofs are those that slope in various directions. Flat roofs<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are those with very little or no slope – most of which are perfectly horizontal and are built from reinforced concrete. A roof can be a composite<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that contains a combination of any two or more of the aforementioned categories. Some roofs are designed to accommodate chimneys, some designed to carry the load from as little as a household antenna to as heavy as radio communication towers as well as water storage tanks and roof-top open swimming pools, sports court, sit-outs, etc.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most gable, hipped, mono-pitch, scatter and composite roofs are covered either of asbestos, corrugated zinc, corrugated aluminium, glass, oven-baked tiles<\/span><b> (<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with popular style including Milano, Gerald, Shingle etc.<\/span><b>). <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not many flat roofs are covered with any of the materials listed above and care should be taken to avoid the use of any of them materials singlehandedly in covering a flat roof because there are a number of issues associated with that most of which include unwanted water retention after a period of time and poor run-off potentials leading to persistent leakages.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep your flat roof water-tight always, you have to;<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  <\/span> <b>Design it properly: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flat roofs, besides scatter roofs and other complex roof systems are seen as the most critical type of roofs when keeping water completely out is the goal. When designing this type of roofs, if you are not a fan of concrete roofs and you are keened on the use of other materials, you should give it a little slope at least. The toast is -your roof is still regarded as flat even with a 4° slope. The slope is needed because metal or composite sheets don’t do well in water runoff over time when they are perfectly horizontal and this is why -due to the effect of temperature changes they expand and contrast and begin to form voids that retain water. The water retain begins to wreak havoc on small openings and joinery points even when overlapped up to the extent that they find their way to the other side. Overall, it is better to design such roofs with reinforced concrete in mind. If the roof is intended to carry load, then there is no sense in using any of the metal coverings. Your structural design must take cognizance of the additional weight to be imposed on the roof in the future as well as its effect as par penetration of rainwater.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  <\/span> <b>Build right:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  Flat roofs are beautiful, especially for contemporary block design concepts, however, if you do not build them right they become a huge turn-off. When using concrete, you need to include a surface finish not exactly for fancy but to damp proof. Bituminous felt and asphaltic coatings can work well here but there must be a proper channel that drains off water collected immediately and it should be installed such that it slopes in the direction of the drain.  All the edges of the flat or concrete roof must be well protected including the parapet where applicable because water only needs a tiny space and boom! There has been increased use of tiles for damp proofing of concrete roofs.

COURT<\/h4>\r\nAnthony Ojigho v. NBA &amp; LPDC (2019) LPELR-46895(SC); [2019] 9 NWLR (Pt. 1678) 399.\r\n\r\nA lawyer, Mr. Anthony Ojigho, was petitioned for fraudulently increasing the price of a property which the Petitioner (Banjo Onanubi) paid the vendor through the lawyer. It was alleged that the lawyer fraudulently induced the Petitioner into paying N40 Million for a property instead of N30 Million that was demanded by the vendor. The case of the Petitioner was that it was the vendor who informed him that the excess sum of N10 Million had been returned to be paid to him through the lawyer being in excess of reserved price. When confronted, the lawyer admitted the wrongdoing and made an initial refund of N3 Million and issued a cheque for the repayment of outstanding N7 Million which he later countermanded (stopped).\r\n\r\nAt the hearing, the lawyer failed to enter a formal defence and chose not to appear at the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee (LPDC) but was instead, represented by his Counsel, Mathias Emeribe. The LPDC held that where a solicitor engrosses an agreement for both the vendor and the purchaser of property, and both of them rely on his legal advice, he is a solicitor to both parties. It is immaterial that one of them introduced him to the other. Thus, the solicitor owes a fiduciary duty to both parties in the circumstance and that the lawyer in the instant case was in breach of same.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/latest-developments-in-eko-atlantic-city\/\"><strong>Latest Developments in Eko Atlantic City<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe LPDC finally held that it was imprudent of the lawyer not to have entered a formal defence and to have sought to defend himself of very serious allegations of professional misconduct and impropriety through the avenue of his Counsel’s Written Address.\r\n\r\nThe LPDC found the lawyer guilty of infamous conduct in the course of the performance of his duty as a legal practitioner and accordingly directed the Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court to strike out his name from the Roll of Legal Practitioners.\r\n\r\nAppeal to Supreme Court\r\nBeing dissatisfied with the decision of the LPDC, the lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court which had no difficulty in dismissing the appeal for lacking in merit. Bage, JSC reasoned as follows:\r\n\r\n“Clearly, the Appellant [the lawyer] acted contrary to his oath as a legal practitioner when he misled the Petitioner to purchase the property at a price other than that which was fixed by the owner. Assuming the Appellant was ‘beclouded’ by a sense of professional duty of maximising the benefit or gains for his client, he had clearly breached this by refusal to pay-over the N10 Million balance demanded and collected in excess of the price fixed for the property.”\r\n\r\nWarning to lawyers and call for ‘cleansing’ This is a warning to all lawyers out there, especially those who also double as property consultants. Being overly too smart does not pay. According to Bage, JSC:\r\n\r\n“The Appellant’s self-deceit smartness is less than a half. Having conducted himself in a rather unprofessional manner, and having also admitted the misconduct by repaying part of the outstanding sums, a prudent Legal practitioner ought to do more by disabusing the minds of an observer as to his ‘saintly’ disposition in the transaction to negative the likely outcome or consequence of lacking in professional decency and probity.\r\n\r\nHe has chosen to lace his bed with stones, pebbles and crumbs of iron and broken bottles; he surely deserves to sleep on the bed alone. This will send appropriate signals to potential violators of Rules of Professional Ethics, 2007 and other applicable provisions of the Legal Practitioners Act 2004. It is my view in this considered Judgment that having regard to the evidence led before the 2nd Respondent, I am convinced beyond any shadow of doubt, that the LPDC was correct in coming to the conclusion that the Appellant was guilty of infamous conduct in discharging his professional duties. I am also of the view that the 2nd Respondent was justified in its direction to the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Nigeria dated December 2, 2013 that the name of the Appellant be struck-off the Roll of Legal Practitioners in Nigeria.”\r\n\r\nHis Lordship also called for some cleaning in the legal profession when he said:\r\n\r\n“We need a sharp depart from infamy in the legal profession. All Judges are first and foremost lawyers. Thus, the bench and the legal profession must continue in internal regulation and\/or self-cleansing. This, in my view is to save the legal profession and invariably the entire structure with which justice is administered in this country. The justice mechanism essentially includes all legal practitioners, and by direct implications all those who practice as solicitors, transaction advisors or as in-house Counsel and law academics.\r\n\r\nThey all belong to the category of ‘Legal Practitioners’. This is because their avoidable professional indiscretion, misconduct, imprudence or lack of probity in written agreements, transaction or advisory and other forms of professional engagements may, and have often formed basis of or cause of action in several suits and appeals.”","post_title":"Supreme Court warning for Lawyers in Real Estate Practice","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"supreme-court-warning-for-lawyers-in-real-estate-practice","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-08-06 09:21:15","post_modified_gmt":"2019-08-06 09:21:15","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/?p=70168","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The house is a 2-storeyed building in a well-known area of Lagos. My apartment was a 2 bedroom flat on the ground floor. It had a spacious, neat compound and well-trimmed flower beds. The environment was serene with good road and also secure. Even electricity supply from PHCN was okay. But what swayed my mind was the fact that all I had to endure to get to work from the house was a short 25-minute drive.\r\n\r\nMy landlord and his wife, both in their early forties, occupied the top floor.He was a retail businessman while his wife ran a small-sized confectionery store. The first time I met them, they were extremely pleasant and seemed genuinely delighted to meet me. We talked at length, touching on a variety of topics that ranged from spinsterhood to balancing work-life schedule. This clearly endeared them to me and I decided on the spot to take the flat. The agreement was drawn up and I paid the rent up to two years. It turned out to be my second major mistake —the first was not carrying out adequate due diligence by asking questions from those I met living in the area.\r\n\r\n[read more=\"Click here to Read More\" less=\"Read Less\"]<b> <\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEverything was smooth for the first seven months. During that period my relationship with the landlord and his wife was as amiable as ever. It wasn’t until eight months after I moved in before I started noticing certain strange events. For one, despite the fact that I was usually always tired once I returned from work, I found it usually difficult to sleep. If I eventually managed to fall asleep, I would wake up almost immediately covered with goose bumps and all my senses tingling. Another thing was the strange people who visited the landlord occasionally at night. They would come in around 9 pm. Any time they came around, there would be a lot of activities all through the night. A few weeks ago, an incident occurred that proved to be the final straw for me. My landlord’s strange visitors arrived as usual. The soft chants and activities went on through the night. I couldn’t sleep.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, I decided that I would approach my landlord to complain about everything. What I saw when I stepped out wiped off that thought from my mind completely. Close to the wall that was adjacent to the main gate, a cubic cement block had been erected. Upon inspection, I found a thin chain attached to the block and the other end cemented to the wall. Locked to the chain was a small red padlock. Upon closer inspection, I found bits of feathers around and what appeared to be drops of blood. I quickly took some photos on my phone and ran away.\r\n\r\nLater when I was narrating the story to my friend, I showed him the photos but all the images were corrupted. All three photos!! I don’t really believe in the metaphysical but with what I have experienced over the past months, I’m beginning to have a rethink. My friend thinks I am being paranoid. Its been almost three weeks since I stepped into the house as I am extremely scared and don’t know what to do. Should I lose my rent and save my life?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.popt.in\/landing\/32d72a608215b\"><img src=\"https:\/\/castles.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Subscribe-300x292.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b> <\/b>[\/read]","post_title":"What Should I Do About My Voodoo Loving Landlord?","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"trash","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"what-should-i-do-about-my-voodoo-loving-landlord__trashed","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-03-16 06:56:53","post_modified_gmt":"2019-03-16 06:56:53","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/test.castles.com.ng\/?p=5787","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},
